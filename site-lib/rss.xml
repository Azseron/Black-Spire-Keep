If you can’t perform the ritual, you can’t cast the spell! For instance, if the ritual for a spell requires you to speak, you cannot cast the spell if you are gagged or under a spell of silence. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The higher your skill with a spell, the easier it is to cast: it takes less time, requires less energy, and has less stringent ritual requirements. See the list below for details. In all cases, “skill” refers to base skill, not effective skill. The only modifier that matters here is the -5 for low mana, if applicable.Skill 9 or less – Ritual: You must have both hands and both feet free for elaborate ritual movements,and you must speak certain words of power in a firm voice. Time: Doubled. Cost: As listed. Skill 10-14 – Ritual: You must speak a few quiet words and make a gesture. Time: As listed. Cost: As listed. Skill 15-19 – Ritual: You must speak a word or two or make a small gesture (a couple of fingers are enough), but not necessarily both. You are allowed to move one yard per second while taking the Concentrate maneuver. Time: As listed. Cost: Reduced by 1. Skill 20-24 – Ritual: None! You simply stare into space as you concentrate. Time: Halved (round fractions up to the next second). Minimum casting time is still one second. Cost: Reduced by 2. Skill 25-29 – Ritual: None. Time: Divided by 4 (round up). Cost: Reduced by 3. Skill 30 or more – As above, but for every five levels of skill beyond skill 25 (that is, at levels 30, 35, 40, etc.), halve casting time again and reduce energy cost by one more point. &nbsp;Certain spells always require a specific ritual. Such requirements override the rules above. For instance, high skill has no effect on the cost to cast Blocking spells (p. 241) or the time to cast Missile spells (p. 240).]]></description><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/magic-(chapter-5)/magic-rituals.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Magic (Chapter 5)/Magic Rituals.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 05:22:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Magery and Effect]]></title><description><![CDATA[Talented mages may exceed the usual limits for spells that allow a finite number of “levels of effect” (dice of damage, bonuses to skill, etc.).

They stay with you if your mind ends up in a new body. This category includes the vast majority of "magical," "psionic," and "spiritual" traits.Mental disadvantages are marked 3.Physical disadvantages are associated with your body. You can escape them by moving to a new body! If another mind occupies your body, the new owner gains your physical disadvantages.You can acquire a physical disadvantage during play, most likely due to accident or combat. In this case, you immediately suffer the bad effects of the disadvantage. Unlike starting disadvantages, however, physical handicaps acquired in play do not "give back" points with which to buy abilities - they just lower your point value!Example: If you start out blind, you start with an extra 50 points . . . but if an explosion blinds you during the game, you're just blind and that's that. Reduce your point total by 50 points to reflect your new disadvantage. You should not keep the same point total and take 50 points of compensating advantages!Physical disadvantages are marked 1.Social disadvantages are associated with your identity. Should it become important to know whether they go with mind or body, the GM's word is I final. Note that this category includes below-average Status, Wealth, and so I forth from Chapter 1.Social disadvantages are marked 2.The GM is the final judge of which category a disadvantage belongs in. It is possible to interpret certain disadvantages in more than one way!Exotic disadvantages are forbidden to normal humans. Nonhumans may acquire such traits from their racial template (see Chapter 7), but they still need the GM's permission to take additional exotic disadvantages.Exotic disadvantages are marked 4.Supernatural disadvantages are the result of divine intervention, magic, psionics, etc. With the GM's permission, anyone might be cursed in this way - but only if supernatural powers exist in the game world.Supernatural disadvantages are marked 5.Mundane disadvantages are everything else. They are inborn, acquired, or self-imposed handicaps that anyone might have. Mundane disadvantages are not marked in any special way. Assume that a disadvantage with neither 9 nor / is available to anyone.1234567890]]></description><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/disadvantages/types-of-disadvantages.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Disadvantages/Types of Disadvantages.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 05:22:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Self-Control for Mental Disadvantages]]></title><description><![CDATA[Many mental disadvantages do not affect you constantly - you may attempt to control your urges. An asterisk (*) appears next to the point cost of any disadvantage that offers a chance to resist. For each disadvantage like this, you must choose a selfcontrol number: the number you must roll on 3d to avoid giving in. This modifies point value as follows:You resist quite rarely (roll of 6 or less): 2 x listed cost.You resist fairly often (roll of 9 or less): 1.5 x listed cost.You resist quite often (roll of 12 or less): listed cost.You resist almost all the time (roll of 15 or less): 0.5 x listed cost.Drop all fractions (e.g., -22.5 points becomes -22 points).The "default" self-control number is 12: you must roll 12 or less on 3d to avoid giving in to your problem. This lets you use disadvantage costs as written. Choose a self-control number of 15 if you wish to have a tendency toward a disadvantage instead of a full-blown case. A self-control number of 9 will regularly limit your options. A self-control number of 6 can be crippling (especially with genuine psychiatric problems).Note your self-control number in parentheses after the name of the disadvantage on your character sheet. For instance, if you can resist Berserk on a roll of 9 or less, write this as "Berserk (9)."In circumstances that are likely to trigger your problem, you may opt to roll 3d against your self-control number to see whether your disadvantage actually affects you. If you roll less than or equal to this number, you resist your disadvantage - this time. Otherwise, you suffer the listed effects. This is called a self-control roll.Like all success rolls, self-control rolls arc subject to modifiers. Exceptionally mild or severe stimuli can give bonuses or penalties. Drugs and afflictions can make you more or less likely to give in. Other disadvantages can make you irritable, reducing your odds of resisting. See the disadvantage descriptions for details.Example: Your self-control number is 15, but you are in a highly stressful situation that gives -5 to your self-control roll. You must roll 10 or less to resist your disadvantage. You never have to try a self-control roll - you can always give in willingly, and it is good roleplaying to do so. However, there will be times when you really need to resist your urges, and that is what the roll is for. Be aware that if you attempt self-control rolls too often, the GM may penalize you for bad roleplaying by awarding you fewer earned points.Optionally, the GM may permit you to use one unspent character point to "buy" an automatic success on a selfcontrol roll. Points spent this way are gone for good, but there will be times when staying on the straight and narrow is worth the sacrifice. In this case, the GM should not penalize you for bad roleplaying, because you are penalizing yourself!Note that high Will helps you make Fright Checks and resist supernatural emotion control, but it does not improve self-control rolls - not even for disadvantages with effects identical to these things. Mental disadvantages represent an aspect of your personality that you cannot simply will (or reason) away. This is part of what makes them disadvantages!]]></description><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/disadvantages/self-control-for-mental-disadvantages.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Disadvantages/Self-Control for Mental Disadvantages.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 05:22:42 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Magic Items]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Life continues on the surface—jobs, traffic, summer festivals—but beneath that normalcy sits a growing lattice of Gates, quarantines, and quiet emergency powers.

Official Stance: Recent incidents are "infrastructure failures" or "terrorist activity."
Restricted Zones: Labeled as "structurally unstable" or "environmental hazards."
Hunter Presence: Framed as "Specialized Contractors" or PMC support for disaster relief. Mana Density: Residual mana is accumulating in underground spaces, warping local geography.
Containment: Monsters have escaped containment at least twice.
The Economy: A hidden economy runs on Mana Cores, operating beneath the official US Dollar system. <a data-href="LOC - The Loop Guild HQ" href="20_world_lore/21_cities/chicago/points_of_interest/loc-the-loop-guild-hq.html" class="internal-link data-link-icon data-link-icon-after data-link-text" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-link-tags="" data-link-path="20_World_Lore/21_Cities/Chicago/Points_of_Interest/LOC - The Loop Guild HQ.md" style="--data-link-path: 20_World_Lore/21_Cities/Chicago/Points_of_Interest/LOC - The Loop Guild HQ.md;">LOC - The Loop Guild HQ</a>: The corporate heart of the Hunter industry.

Smells: Gun oil, ozone, spicy street food, antiseptic ink.
Currency: US Dollars and Mana Cores (preferred for high-end gear). Food Stalls: Mana Broth: Restores 1 FP ($50/bowl).
Cold Barley Tea: Suppresses Fear penalties for 1 hour. The Demolitions Guy: Lena's contact. Never has a sign. Always "just packing up."
Information Brokers: Sit at folding tables with notebooks. Sell rumors for favors. Services: Illegal rune tattoos for Adept Hunters.
The Artist: A mute ink-master who claims to remember the "Old World."
Risk: Tattoos hurt. HT rolls required to avoid temporary shock. Dragovich's Office: Where <a data-href="NPC - Viktor Dragovich" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">NPC - Viktor Dragovich</a> holds court.

Their original art doesn't really make them look very intimidating.Since the earliest days of my pen-and-paper RPG gaming the aboleths were my favorite monsters. What monster can compete with a primordial fish monster with psionic powers? In D&amp;D 3.5 they were first introduced on the first pages of Monster Manual&nbsp;and then brought to their proper psionic shape in Expanded Psionics Handbook. Finally, the lore was greatly expanded in Lords of Madness, one of my favorite D&amp;D splatbooks. Lords of Madness&nbsp;also introduced three new aboleth variants - the stygian aboleth, the amphibious aboleth, and the uobilyth, also known as the aerial aboleth. I am aware of the other variations from the previous editions, such as the greater aboleth and the grand aboleth, but they won't be present in this post. The entries use psionic abilities from GURPS Psionic Powers and some unique psionic or biologial aboleth abilities. The entries are presented as a racial template and as a typical statblock. Bite (11):&nbsp;thrust 2d-2 cutting (KYOS: 3d-3 cutting). Reach C.Tentacle (11):&nbsp;thrust 4d-2 crushing (KYOS: 5d+1 crushing) + follow-up 1d corrosion (10 1-minute cycles, HT-3 resist). Reach C. 1-3. Being moistened with cool, fresh water negates cycle damage. Using the follow-up damage costs 1 FP.Mucus Cloud (HT): Any creature that makes skin-to-skin contact with the aboleth must make a successful HT roll or lose the ability to breathe air and gain that ability to breathe water for a number of minutes equal to the margin of failure. Using this ability costs 1 FP.Mental Blow (15): The aboleth can overload someone’s brain with a powerful psychic attack. If it wins a Quick Contest of skill vs. his victim’s Will (use the range penalties on the Size and Speed/Range Table (B550)), his victim is stunned. On subsequent turns, he can roll against Will to snap out of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traits: Amphibious; Callous; Doesn’t Breathe (Gills);

If a rule is not stated here, it is either:
An optional expansion A GM ruling A derived consequence of these rules When in doubt, this document overrides all others.The campaign uses GURPS 4th Edition as its mechanical base.The following books are considered rules-valid sources:
GURPS Basic Set (Characters &amp; Campaigns) GURPS Magic GURPS Thaumatology GURPS High-Tech GURPS Dungeon Fantasy (select material) GURPS Monster Hunters (select material) Rules from these books apply only where not superseded by this manifest.
Characters are cinematic but mortal Combat is fast, decisive, and dangerous Magic is powerful, flexible, and risky The game assumes competent protagonists, not average civilians Optional cinematic rules may be used at the GM’s discretion, but core mechanics remain grounded in GURPS resolution.
Characters may Move and Attack in the same turn without penalty, unless performing: All-Out Attacks All-Out Defenses This rule applies equally to PCs and NPCs Retreats, defenses, and active reactions function normally This replaces standard GURPS movement/attack limitations.All rolls use standard 3d6 roll-under mechanics.
Margin of Success (MoS) is always calculated Margin of Failure (MoF) matters when relevant When multiple skills are rolled for a single action, the lowest MoS is used Critical successes and failures follow Basic Set rules unless explicitly overridden.Magic does not use fixed spell lists.All magic is constructed using Symbols, divided into:Create, Move, Control, Sense, Heal, Protect, WeakenAir, Water, Fire, Earth, Body, Mind, Light, Sound, Plant, Animal, Necromancy, Knowledge, Meta-MagicA spell consists of:
1 Verb 1–3 Nouns Example:
Create + Fire → Fireball Control + Light → Invisibility To cast a spell:
Roll each involved Symbol skill
Determine MoS for each roll
The lowest MoS becomes the spell’s final MoS
MoS determines the spell’s strength and scaling
If any required roll fails, the spell fails.MoS determines the tier of effect, not just success.Exact mechanical outcomes are defined by the GM using these tiers as guidance.
Magery governs: Maximum complexity of spells Maximum MoS spent per effect category A character may not spend more MoS on a single effect category than their Magery level Excess MoS may still be used, but increases magical risk (see Threshold Magic) Magic uses Threshold Magic, not fatigue-based costs.
Each spell adds Threshold (T) instead of FP cost Threshold recovers over time at a fixed rate Exceeding Threshold risks Calamities Minor spells: 1–3 T Moderate spells: 4–6 T Major / Ultimate spells: 7–10+ T Calamities are magical, narrative, and potentially severe.
Maintaining a spell is passive Casting a new spell while maintaining one imposes a –2 penalty per maintained spell Failure affects only the newly cast spell unless Threshold backlash occurs Damage uses standard GURPS damage types and DR Area effects, homing effects, control effects, etc. are determined by MoS allocation Magic may create effects that mimic Advantages, Attacks, or Conditions, but does not grant permanent traits unless explicitly allowed Technology Level is modern (TL8 baseline unless stated otherwise) Equipment legality, black markets, and scarcity are enforced Modern weapons are lethal; armor matters Technomagical items exist but are rare and controlled Monsters are ecological entities, not XP bundles Stat blocks emphasize: Behavior Ecology Tactics Monsters may retreat, negotiate, or act irrationally Not all encounters are balanced or fair Character advancement is point-based Advancement may occur through: Training Study Story milestones Exceptional play Power growth is intentional but controlled The GM:
Interprets MoS outcomes Defines narrative consequences Adjudicates edge cases However, the GM does not override core mechanics without explicitly declaring a house rule.This document does three crucial things:
It locks physics before lore
It separates rules from rulings
It gives players confidence that mastery is possible
Next logical steps (when you’re ready):
A Magic Allocation Cheat Sheet (MoS → Damage / Area / Control) A Combat Reference Card for modern + magic interaction A “GM Only” Design Appendix explaining why these rules exist (kept out of player view) When you want, we can tighten this further for table print, or build the next layer without contaminating the core.should each section be its own note? like should 1. System Baseline have its own note?Short answer first, because clarity beats ceremony:No — not at first.
The Core Rules Manifest should remain one single note.Now the longer, more interesting answer: why that’s true, and when it stops being true.A constitution is powerful precisely because it’s hard to fragment.Your Core Rules Manifest is not a reference manual. It’s a statement of reality. The moment you split it into multiple notes, three bad things start happening:
Authority diffuses
Players (and future-you) start asking “Which note overrides which?”
Drift sneaks in
One section gets quietly updated, another doesn’t. Congratulations — you’ve invented accidental edition wars.
Obsidian starts lying
Links make everything look equally important, even when it isn’t.
A constitution lives or dies by coherence. One file forces coherence.Right now, your manifest should be:
One document that can be printed, handed to a player, and sworn upon.
If you cannot print it as a single artifact without losing meaning, it’s too fragmented.There is a correct time to split — just not yet.You split only when a section gains subordinate structure.Here’s the rule of thumb:
A section becomes its own note only when it needs children.
Let’s apply that to your examples.1. System Baseline
This is declarative. It names books and authority. It has no moving parts.If it were its own note, you’d gain nothing and risk someone “editing the foundation.”Same for:
Tone and Power Assumptions Action Economy GM Authority Clause These are axioms, not systems.Unified Symbol Magic SystemRight now, it belongs in the manifest as a law.
Later, it will absolutely spawn:
Magic Allocation Tables Example Spells Edge Cases Design Rationale Player vs GM guidance When that happens, the manifest keeps the summary, and a separate document becomes:
“Unified Symbol Magic — Full Rules”
The manifest links outward, but never imports detail inward.These will eventually want their own notes:
Monsters (already happening naturally) Equipment economies Advancement rules Faction mechanics Dungeon / Gate rules But note the pattern:
Those are procedural systems, not constitutional laws.Here’s the rule that prevents vault collapse:
Top-level documents never link sideways. They only link downward.
Your Core Rules Manifest should:
Sit at the root Have no backlinks that alter it Be referenced, not edited casually Everything else orbits it.For now, I’d suggest:00 - CORE RULES MANIFEST.md 01 - Magic System (Expansion).md 02 - Combat &amp; Damage Clarifications.md 03 - Monsters &amp; Ecology.md 04 - Equipment &amp; Economy.md GM - Design Notes (Private).mdNotice:
The manifest stays singular Expansions explain, but do not redefine GM notes are quarantined Fragmentation feels productive.
Coherence is productive.You’ve already done the hard work: designing a system that hangs together. The manifest’s job is to freeze that coherence.Once the ice is solid, then you can build cities on top of it.Next time, if you want, we can:
Mark which sentences in the manifest are link anchors Decide which sections are immutable vs versioned Or design a “Player Cut” vs “GM Cut” without duplicating rules You’re building this the right way.]]></description><link>10_system_rules/rule-campaign-constitution.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/RULE - Campaign Constitution.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 19:23:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Verb - Weaken]]></title><description><![CDATA[Function: Damage, debuff, decay, corrode, erode, exhaust, or impair.

Create barriers (hard-light wall, stone rampart)
Generate temporary constructs/tools (light platforms, stone steps)
Produce persistent zones (wall of fire, fog bank) if MoS is spent on area/duration
Summon simple entities with the right Noun (e.g., Necromancy for undead) as allowed by the GM Precisely shape/steer complex effects (add Control)
Launch created effects at convincing speed (add Move if needed)
Permanently create valuable matter (GM should cap this via cost/ritual/special rules) Create + Fire: fireball, flame jet, ignition, burning aura
Create + Water: jets, ice formation (often add Earth for shaping spikes)
Create + Light: illusions, flashes, hard-light constructs
Create + Earth: walls, spikes, weapons, debris fields
Create + Necromancy: raise undead, summon spirits (GM sets limits) Usually 1–2 seconds for simple attacks; 3 seconds for “ultimate” area denial
For AOEs: MoS often goes to area + duration more than damage If the player wants a “named spell,” ask: What Verb? What Noun(s)?

In addition, if it is moving through an SM+2 or smaller creature, this counts as an automatic slam attempt (Pyramid # 3-77, p. 6). Failure to dodge means being sucked inside and pinned if of lower SM than the black pudding, or partly stuck in the black pudding and grappled if of equal or greater SM. The victim can break free by winning a Quick Contest of ST (allowed only every 10 seconds if pinned; and on a 17 or 18, he becomes so entangled that he cannot escape on his own); the black pudding has +10 to ST if pinning or +5 if grappling. Engulfed victims cannot breathe. If they run out of breath before they break free, they start to suffocate (see&nbsp;Holding Your Breath, p. B351 and&nbsp;Suffocation, p. B436). The typical black pudding can pin/grapple one foe; later enemies are pushed along in front of it unless they win a Quick Contest of ST to prevent it from moving. The black pudding can actively constrict engulfed victims, attacking them each turn with a Constriction Attack (p. B43). This ability has effective ST 24.Acid:&nbsp;The creature secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material and metal, but does not affect stone. Any organic or metal creature or object touching the black pudding takes 1d-1 corrosion damage per second. Engulfed creatures and objects take it as&nbsp;Large-Area Injury&nbsp;(p. B400).Ooze Senses:&nbsp;An ooze’s entire body is a primitive sensory organ that can ascertain prey by scent and vibration. It uses standard range penalties instead of a -1/yard penalty when detecting smells, and gets a +5 bonus on Smell and Taste rolls (Sense roll 15). Its smell operates both in air and underwater. In addition, the ooze can detect vibrations in the air. It can locate prey in the dark, but cannot detect details. To use Vibration Sense, the ooze must make a Sense roll (10). Consult the&nbsp;Size and Speed/Range Table&nbsp;(p. B550) and apply&nbsp;separate&nbsp;bonuses for the target’s size and speed, and a penalty for the range to the target. Wind will generate “noise” that interferes with this sense. Find the speed of the wind on the table and assess the relevant speed penalty. A successful roll reveals the rough size, location, speed, and direction of movement of the target, allowing the ooze to move to it and attempt to engulf it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traits:&nbsp;Amphibious; Blindness; Clinging; Doesn’t Breathe; Doesn’t Sleep; Hidebound; High Pain Threshold; Immunity to Metabolic Hazards; Injury Tolerance (Homogenous, No Blood, No Eyes, No Head, No Neck); Invertebrate; Mute; No Legs (Slithers); No Manipulators; Slippery 5.Notes: Size 13 hexes; Weight 18,000 lbs.Creature Type**:**&nbsp;Ooze.118 pointsAttribute Modifiers:&nbsp;ST+24 (Size Modifier, -50%; No Manipulators, -40%) [42]; DX-2 [-40]; IQ-10 [-200]; HT+2 [20].Secondary Characteristic Modifiers:&nbsp;SM+5; HP+70 (Size Modifier, -50%) [70]; Per+10 [50]; Basic Move-4 [-20].Advantages:&nbsp;Amphibious [10]; Clinging [20]; Doesn’t Breathe [20]; Doesn’t Sleep [20]; High Pain Threshold [10]; Immunity to Metabolic Hazards [30]; Injury Tolerance (Homogenous, No Blood, No Eyes, No Head, No Neck) [62]; Slippery 5 [10].Acid: Corrosion Attack 1d-1 (Accessibility, Only on organic materials or metal, -10%; Always On, -20%; Aura, +80%; Melee Attack, Reach C, -30%; Selective Effect, +20%) [10].Engulf: Binding 24 (Always On, -20%; Aura, +80%; Constricting, Only on smaller targets, +55%; Engulfing, Only on smaller targets, +40%; Melee Attack, Reach C, -30%; One-Shot, -10%; Selective Effect, +20%; Suffocating, Only on smaller targets, +55%; Unbreakable, +40%) [160].Ooze Senses&nbsp;[21]: Acute Taste and Smell 5 [10] + Long-Range Smell [1] + Universal Smell [1] + Vibration Sense (Air) [10].Disadvantages:&nbsp;Blindness [-50]; Hidebound [-5]; Invertebrate [-20]; Mute [-25]; No Manipulators [-50].Features:&nbsp;No Legs (Slithers) [0].Notes: Size 13 hexes; Weight 18,000 lbs.Creature Type: Ooze.Knowing Your Own Strength [328]Replace ST+24 (Size Modifier, -50%; No Manipulators, -40%) [42] with ST+24 [240]Replace HP+70 (Size Modifier, -50%) [70] with HP+70 [140]Typical Stats – Elder Black PuddingEngulf:&nbsp;If the black pudding starts its turn in close combat with prey or can move there on its turn, it tries to engulf its target; no attack roll is necessary and its quarry may defend only by dodging and retreating.

“Joint Aviation Security Modernization Annex”
What the public sees:
One runway “under long-term resurfacing” A cargo terminal marked “federal operations” Increased TSA + National Guard presence Drone restrictions expanded Occasional military aircraft parked far from passenger gates Most travelers never get near the restricted side.
Terminals 1–3 active Domestic and international flights continue Retail and passenger operations normal Visible but non-threatening security presence Air travel remains a symbol that “the world is still functioning.”This is the gray space.
Cargo Terminal 5 partially federalized One maintenance hangar cluster converted A decommissioned runway sector used for testing Controlled access roads branching off main airport arteries To most airport workers:
“It’s a federal training area.”
Hidden behind secure fencing and blast walls:
Core stabilization chambers Containment vaults Density measurement labs Artifact quarantine rooms This is where monster cores get:
graded catalogued stabilized shipped Military cargo aircraft staged Hunter contractor staging rooms Gear lockers Briefing rooms Tactical airlift capability If a Gate opens in the Midwest, response time is measured in hours.On the “under repair” runway:
Portable mana dampening arrays Field tests of sealing tech Live-fire containment drills Artifact stress testing This runway is long enough to:
chase large entities deploy heavy weapons test aerial anomalies Airports are honeycombs underneath.Below MALC:
Mana compression research Energy extraction experiments Core amplification testing Secure holding cells There are rumors of:
Something airborne that cannot leave its chamber A Gate fragment under study A “partial seal” being reverse engineered Outer ring:
Normal airport policing Increased federal presence Surveillance disguised as aviation security Inner ring:
Military police Arcane suppression grids Hardened blast doors Black badge access only If civilians wander too close?
They’re rerouted politely.If hunters wander too close?
They’re questioned seriously.Would the government do this?Yes.Because:
Airports already handle sensitive federal traffic. They have perimeter control. They have hardened infrastructure. They have massive cargo capacity. They are strategically connected. Shutting O’Hare down screams crisis.Embedding a black-site inside it screams competence.Keeping O’Hare active gives you:
Hunters boarding commercial flights while classified cargo loads nearby. A containment test happening during peak air traffic. A monster escaping into baggage handling. A mana surge disrupting navigation systems. A corporate spy disguised as an airline contractor. A Gate flare interfering with radar. You get thriller energy, not bunker energy.]]></description><link>20_world_lore/21_cities/chicago/points_of_interest/loc-o&apos;hare-containment-zone.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">20_World_Lore/21_Cities/Chicago/Points_of_Interest/LOC - O&apos;Hare Containment Zone.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 17:10:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[LOC - The Loop Guild HQ]]></title><link>20_world_lore/21_cities/chicago/points_of_interest/loc-the-loop-guild-hq.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">20_World_Lore/21_Cities/Chicago/Points_of_Interest/LOC - The Loop Guild HQ.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 17:04:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[LOC - Navy Pier Gate]]></title><description><![CDATA[
Threat Rating: A-Rank Condition: Sealed but unstable Public Story: “Structural damage and ongoing renovations” Real Status: Active mana pressure behind containment barriers Control: Joint Federal + City + Classified Task Group The Gate opened:
Inside the Festival Hall complex During off-peak hours Initial manifestation: gravity distortion + light inversion Witness footage was scrubbed within hours.The response was immediate — but wrong.Federal containment assumed:
Urban dungeon interior Limited surface breach risk Predictable monster behavior They were incorrect.This Gate isn’t just high-damage.It’s high-reality.Confirmed internal characteristics:
Non-Euclidean interior geometry Floating architectural fragments Spatial folding corridors Creatures not bound by gravity Time dilation pockets Two recon teams entered.One team returned altered.
The other never exited.The Gate was sealed externally before a full clear.The “seal” is not mystical.It’s:
Physical barricades Electromagnetic interference grids Mana-dampening arrays (experimental) Armed federal response at all hours Structural reinforcement of the pier deck The Ferris wheel is dark at night now.No fireworks this summer.Public-facing measures:
Construction fencing Renovation permits Closed attractions Increased Coast Guard patrols Drone surveillance Most Chicagoans think it’s:
“Storm damage repairs.”
The wealthy are quietly leaving downtown.Navy Pier is symbolic.If this becomes public:
National media explosion Financial panic Federal emergency declarations International signaling of instability This is not a neighborhood problem.This is optics warfare.If cleared:
A-Rank core yield Unique artifacts Spatial manipulation materials Possible gravity-aligned magic resources Corporations are salivating.The Guild is cautious.The government is divided.
Ferris wheel lights flicker when inactive Boats report compass deviation offshore Birds avoid the pier Glass vibrates without wind Water near the pier has micro-whirlpools at night The seal is holding.For now.“Destroy it entirely. Collapse the structure if needed.”“Study it. This is a breakthrough in applied spatial science.”“Do not attempt full clear without S-Rank presence.”Some believe:
The Gate is not random The lake is “watching” Something beneath Lake Michigan stirred This is not a dungeon crawl.It’s:
A stealth infiltration A political minefield A time bomb A prestige contract A forbidden temptation If the PCs enter this Gate:
They are no longer small players. They are operating in a national crisis. The main promenade Select restaurants Some retail shops Portions of the outdoor areas Daytime boat tours (restricted routes) Crowds are thinner than usual, but tourists still come.Security presence is visibly higher — but framed as:
“summer safety measures” “infrastructure updates” “crowd control improvements” Festival Hall interior (where the Gate opened) Several internal corridors Underground maintenance access Portions of the pier’s central structure Rooftop access These areas are behind:
construction walls “Renovation in Progress” signage armed but low-profile security The city understands something crucial:
If you shut down a landmark, people assume catastrophe.
If you partially shut it down, they assume construction.
So the pier operates at maybe 60% capacity.Enough life to look normal.
Enough restriction to hide something.
Ferris wheel occasionally “under maintenance” Random closures with short notice Helicopters at night Lake patrol activity increased Strange humming in some areas Unusual no-drone enforcement Conspiracy forums are active.
Mainstream media is uninterested.The Gate is sealed inside the closed section.The seal:
Is mechanical + experimental mana dampening Is monitored constantly Has fluctuated twice in the past month Guild intel classifies it as:
“Dormant under pressure. Not resolved.”
Which means:It’s not dead.Three reasons: Economic optics
Chicago cannot afford to project instability. Federal denial posture
Full closure = admission of uncontrolled anomaly. Testing behavior
The government wants to observe: mana diffusion under civilian load structural strain under vibration emotional/psychic interference Yes, they are measuring whether large crowds affect the Gate.They are not telling anyone.If PCs visit Navy Pier:
No immediate danger Security watches everyone Subtle mana distortion checks Rumor opportunities Increased military presence Magical interference Restricted access Possible containment alarms Much tighter lockdown Coast Guard presence Federal rapid-response team on standby The Navy Pier Gate is not dangerous because it’s open.It’s dangerous because:
It’s sealed imperfectly. It’s in the middle of the skyline. And if it fails during peak summer hours… That’s not a dungeon incident.That’s a national trauma event.These are businesses the city needs open to maintain the illusion.
Mid-range seafood restaurant (reduced seating) Deep-dish pizza spot (busy but understaffed) Tourist burger &amp; bar chain Coffee shop (heavily frequented by security personnel) Ice cream / funnel cake stand (seasonal, open weekends only) Vibe:
Open, but slightly emptier than peak summer. Staff are jumpy when Festival Hall is mentioned.
National coffee chain Local craft coffee cart Popcorn / cotton candy vendor Bottled water and souvenir kiosks Vibe:
High foot traffic. Tourists unaware. Employees whisper about “construction delays.”
Ferris wheel (intermittent operation) Carousel Some arcade games Outdoor seating areas Public art exhibits Not operating:
Indoor festival events Large exhibitions Major summer concert programming The Ferris wheel occasionally “shuts down for maintenance.”
Players may notice it stalls briefly when mana fluctuations spike.
Souvenir stores T-shirt shops Chicago sports merchandise Jewelry stand Kids toy store Foot traffic: moderate, not packed.
Limited sightseeing boat tours Dinner cruises (shortened routes) Kayak rentals (restricted zones) Coast Guard presence is higher than normal.
Certain lake coordinates are strictly off-limits.These appear open but are effectively dead.
Event rental offices Indoor theater spaces Private banquet halls Conference areas Some upper-level offices These areas are “under renovation.”
Festival Hall interior Maintenance corridors Loading docks near the Gate anchor point Sub-basement access Several rooftop sections Construction walls are professionally done.
Security presence is subtle but constant.If they look closely:
Security personnel in plain clothes Federal-style unmarked SUVs Radio chatter using unfamiliar call signs Tourists occasionally escorted away from restricted corridors Slight static in cell service near certain walls Light pressure sensation (mages especially) Behind the scenes, the following quietly operate:
Federal monitoring office (temporary) Mana flux instrumentation Structural stress monitoring Rapid response containment team on standby Psychological profiling team reviewing witness footage But none of that is visible unless players go digging.If they attempt:
Accessing closed corridors Questioning staff aggressively Casting magic openly Flying drones Scanning for mana They will trigger:
Soft surveillance first Then quiet intervention Then firm removal This is not Englewood.
This is optics territory.Navy Pier should feel:
80% normal 15% tense 5% wrong That 5% is where your campaign lives.]]></description><link>20_world_lore/21_cities/chicago/points_of_interest/loc-navy-pier-gate.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">20_World_Lore/21_Cities/Chicago/Points_of_Interest/LOC - Navy Pier Gate.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 15:37:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Key Chicago Locations]]></title><description><![CDATA[

marshland slow water liminal ground between lake, river, and land Indigenous peoples avoided permanent settlement here.
Not for superstition—because the ground shifted, flooded, swallowed structures.Even then, it was a place that didn’t like being owned.Chicago’s south industrial expansion turned Calumet into a machine.Steel mills, coke ovens, rail yards, and ship canals were packed together because:
water access rail access political indifference to pollution What that created:
constant vibration extreme heat gradients chemical runoff buried infrastructure layered on buried infrastructure Calumet wasn’t just polluted.
It was mechanically stressed for a century.Steel collapsed. Industry fled.What stayed behind:
sealed tunnels abandoned furnaces slag heaps undocumented voids contaminated groundwater rusting machines still under tension The land didn’t recover.
It hollowed out.By the 1990s, Calumet was already:
semi-forgotten politically convenient to ignore dangerous in mundane ways Which made it perfect later.For decades, Calumet existed as:
“future redevelopment land” EPA problem zones rail corridors no one wanted to map fully Nothing supernatural—just:
sinkholes unexplained fires toxic gas releases structural collapses But here’s the key part for your setting:
Calumet already behaved like a place where reality leaked.
So when Gates began appearing globally…It didn’t open in a neighborhood.It opened inside:
a sealed furnace hall surrounded by slag beneath rusted catwalks above flooded tunnels Sensors didn’t notice immediately.
Cameras didn’t work right.
Heat signatures blended with the environment.By the time anyone understood what had happened:
monsters had space to spread mana had room to pool no civilians were present to trigger alarms The government’s internal conclusion was chilling:
“If a Gate had to open somewhere, this was the least bad place.”
That decision shaped everything.In-world logic, not GM fiat:
The ground is fractured and hollow Old infrastructure forms natural containment chambers Heat and pressure align with fire- and metal-aligned Gates Subterranean networks allow migration Political will to fully cleanse the area is low Calumet isn’t cursed.It’s convenient.Today, Calumet is:
semi-abandoned semi-monitored quietly exploited It’s where:
dangerous Gates are allowed to fester high-value - monster cores are harvested experimental containment is tested failures are buried Englewood taught the city a lesson.Calumet is where that lesson is applied.Among hunters, Calumet is known as:
“The Furnace” “The Open Wound” “Where the city bleeds money” You don’t go there to survive.
You go there to get paid.And maybe not come back.This lets you:
justify recurring Gates without escalation fatigue explain government tolerance seed corporate and cult interest tie Fire Opal–style threats naturally to the region contrast Englewood’s tragedy with Calumet’s exploitation Englewood was an accident.Calumet is a choice.]]></description><link>20_world_lore/21_cities/chicago/points_of_interest/loc-calumet-ruins.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">20_World_Lore/21_Cities/Chicago/Points_of_Interest/LOC - Calumet Ruins.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 15:24:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.openai.com/static-rsc-3/2927p9r2xiOXFhviUQlsOH_TUAhRbleDRa6tLn467_DXBwr3zaKULU_UZgWQQZt_M8PlgrhW3OEFW10VOr1IVjWOqEiaJTciiwK3mlypWhQ?purpose=fullsize&amp;v=1" length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.openai.com/static-rsc-3/2927p9r2xiOXFhviUQlsOH_TUAhRbleDRa6tLn467_DXBwr3zaKULU_UZgWQQZt_M8PlgrhW3OEFW10VOr1IVjWOqEiaJTciiwK3mlypWhQ?purpose=fullsize&amp;v=1&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[LOC - Englewood Dead Zone]]></title><description><![CDATA[Englewood wasn’t destroyed by a single catastrophe.
It was bled out by a bad decision, made quietly, and covered up efficiently.Englewood was the site of the first large-scale containment failure in Chicago—and the place where the government learned that Gates can’t be handled like riots or disasters.Everything that followed across the city was shaped by what happened here.A Gate opened beneath abandoned rail infrastructure near the old industrial corridors.
At first, it looked like another low-tier urban Gate:
Small monster incursions Limited mana bleed Containable footprint Federal response classified it as “manageable.”That was wrong.Instead of a full clear, containment teams:
sealed surface access deployed sensors delayed entry Why?
manpower shortages inter-agency conflict fear of civilian exposure pressure to “not escalate” This allowed mana saturation to build.Englewood had:
abandoned basements old utility tunnels undocumented storm drains vacant housing stock Mana didn’t stay put.
It spread sideways, seeping into places no map fully captured.Creatures:
moved into empty buildings used basements as lairs learned patrol patterns avoided daylight This wasn’t a wave.
It was urban entrenchment.For roughly six days, Englewood experienced:
unexplained fires power failures “gang violence” spikes missing persons first responder withdrawals Police scanners recorded things they weren’t trained to describe.Then… silence.
evacuated several blocks quietly reclassified the zone as structurally unsafe erected “temporary” barriers restricted utility access Then they did something new.They let hunters in.Not officially.
Not publicly.
But deliberately.Englewood became the first proving ground for freelance containment.The Gate was eventually neutralized, but:
not all monsters were killed some escaped underground some adapted to surface conditions mana residue never fully dissipated Official story:
“Infrastructure failure combined with criminal activity.”
Unofficial truth:
Englewood was a lesson written in bodies. Sections are walled off Others are “open” but watched Utilities are unreliable by design Surveillance is heavy but indirect The ground feels wrong in places Hunters know:
it’s not clean it’s not safe it’s not finished The government knows:
full disclosure here would unravel everything Englewood is:
proof Gates can metastasize the reason Chicago’s response is so harsh now a source of feral monsters a cult recruitment ground a place where people saw too much It’s why:
Lakeshore is locked down fast the Loop is watched obsessively the Subterranean Market expanded hunters are tolerated instead of crushed “Something’s still alive down there.” “They never found the original anchor.” “A crew went in last month. No exit log.” “Cores from Englewood behave wrong.” “That place remembers violence.” Some of those are true.Englewood isn’t a dungeon.
It’s a scar.You don’t clear it.
You survive it.
And you don’t forget what it taught the city.]]></description><link>20_world_lore/21_cities/chicago/points_of_interest/loc-englewood-dead-zone.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">20_World_Lore/21_Cities/Chicago/Points_of_Interest/LOC - Englewood Dead Zone.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 20:52:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Chicago_map]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img class="zm-image" src="99_reference/chicago-map-illinois.jpg" target="_self">Zoom: 36%]]></description><link>20_world_lore/21_cities/chicago/chicago_map.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">20_World_Lore/21_Cities/Chicago/Chicago_map.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 17:09:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="99_reference/chicago-map-illinois.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;99_reference/chicago-map-illinois.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Chicago-Map-Illinois.markers]]></title><link>chicago-map-illinois.markers.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Chicago-Map-Illinois.markers.json</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 17:08:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dungeon of the Fire Opal]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img alt="Dungeon of the Fire Opal.png" src="50_atlas/52_active_gates/03_dungeons/dungeon-of-the-fire-opal.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>50_atlas/52_active_gates/03_dungeons/dungeon-of-the-fire-opal.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">50_Atlas/52_Active_Gates/03_Dungeons/Dungeon of the Fire Opal.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 18:52:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cult_of_Koga_Thun]]></title><link>20_world_lore/22_factions/cult_of_koga_thun.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">20_World_Lore/22_Factions/Cult_of_Koga_Thun.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 02:45:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hunters_Guild]]></title><link>20_world_lore/22_factions/hunters_guild.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">20_World_Lore/22_Factions/Hunters_Guild.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 02:45:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[US_Government]]></title><link>20_world_lore/22_factions/us_government.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">20_World_Lore/22_Factions/US_Government.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 02:45:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[World_Overview]]></title><link>20_world_lore/world_overview.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">20_World_Lore/World_Overview.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 02:45:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Resonant_Weapons]]></title><link>60_armory/61_equipment/weapons/resonant_weapons.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">60_Armory/61_Equipment/Weapons/Resonant_Weapons.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 15:12:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Silvered_Weapons]]></title><link>60_armory/61_equipment/weapons/silvered_weapons.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">60_Armory/61_Equipment/Weapons/Silvered_Weapons.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 15:12:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Melee_Weapons]]></title><link>60_armory/61_equipment/weapons/melee_weapons.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">60_Armory/61_Equipment/Weapons/Melee_Weapons.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 15:12:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Firearms]]></title><link>60_armory/61_equipment/weapons/firearms.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">60_Armory/61_Equipment/Weapons/Firearms.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 15:12:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Overview]]></title><link>60_armory/61_equipment/overview.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">60_Armory/61_Equipment/Overview.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 15:06:45 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dungeon of the Fire Opal]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="50_atlas/52_active_gates/03_dungeons/dungeon-of-the-fire-opal.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>50_atlas/52_active_gates/03_dungeons/dungeon-of-the-fire-opal.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">50_Atlas/52_Active_Gates/03_Dungeons/Dungeon of the Fire Opal.png</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 00:57:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[All_POIs]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dataview: No results to show for table query.]]></description><link>20_world_lore/21_cities/chicago/all_pois.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">20_World_Lore/21_Cities/Chicago/All_POIs.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 22:08:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Overview]]></title><description><![CDATA[Chicago in June 2025 is a contained crisis city. Life continues on the surface—jobs, traffic, summer festivals—but beneath that normalcy sits a growing lattice of Gates, quarantines, and quiet emergency powers. The public knows something is wrong. They do not know how wrong.The city has not collapsed. It has adapted.
A series of "containment incidents" tied to infrastructure failures, chemical leaks, and extremist activity. Certain neighborhoods are restricted due to "structural instability" or "environmental hazards." Increased federal presence is framed as counter-terrorism and disaster preparedness. Viral footage of "animals" or "riots" is dismissed as hoaxes or misinterpretations. Most people assume this is temporary.
Chicago is one of the highest Gate-density cities in North America. Several Gates have already been neutralized; others remain dormant, sealed, or unacknowledged. Residual mana is accumulating in underground spaces, old infrastructure, and abandoned buildings. Monsters have escaped containment at least twice. Cult activity is confirmed and escalating. Hunters understand that Chicago is being managed, not saved.
Emergency authority invoked under existing disaster and homeland security frameworks. A dedicated task force operates quietly through shell agencies and utilities departments. Data is classified aggressively; whistleblowers disappear into legal limbo. City Hall cooperates under pressure. Police and fire departments receive limited briefings. First responders are told to withdraw from certain zones without explanation. Officially, no supernatural threat exists.Chicago hosts a large freelance hunter population, larger than average due to:
High Gate frequency Abundant underground access points Strong black-market infrastructure Hunter culture in Chicago is:
Pragmatic Suspicious Highly networked Less heroic, more professional Reputation matters. Carelessness spreads quickly.Beneath the streets exists a parallel ecosystem:
Abandoned subway spurs Flooded service tunnels Utility corridors Forgotten bomb shelters These spaces house:
The Subterranean Market Hunter safehouses Illegal clinics Artifact brokers Cult hideouts This underground is alive, shifting nightly.
Government containment units (covert) Independent hunter crews Corporate interests (research &amp; salvage) Religious and esoteric cults Information brokers and fixers No single group is fully in control.
Gates appear unpredictably but favor older structures and underground spaces. Some Gates destabilize after partial clearing. Smaller "micro-Gates" open briefly, often ignored until damage is done. Mana residue persists after closure, warping environments. The Fire Opal Gate is one of the most dangerous confirmed examples.
Summer heat mixed with unease Increased police presence without explanation Closed streets and construction zones everywhere Rumors spreading faster than facts A sense that something big is coming Chicago feels watched.Use Chicago as:
A living hub between Gates A pressure cooker for faction conflict A place where choices have visible consequences A city that reacts to hunter actions Nothing resets between sessions.
"A Gate opened under the lake. They sealed it, but something escaped." "Someone is paying double for fire-aligned cores." "A cult thinks a god is about to be reborn." "The tunnels are changing. Old maps don’t work anymore." "Hunters went in last week. No bodies came out." Some of these are true.Chicago is not a dungeon.It is a system under stress.The players are not saviors.They are specialists operating in the cracks.]]></description><link>20_world_lore/21_cities/chicago/overview.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">20_World_Lore/21_Cities/Chicago/Overview.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 23:36:46 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Index - GM Screen]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dataview: No results to show for list query.Dataview: No results to show for table query.Dataview: No results to show for table query.]]></description><link>10_system_rules/13_magic_system/unified-symbol-magic/indexes/index-gm-screen.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/13_Magic_System/Unified Symbol Magic/Indexes/Index - GM Screen.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 23:08:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Index - All Notes]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dataview: No results to show for table query.]]></description><link>10_system_rules/13_magic_system/unified-symbol-magic/indexes/index-all-notes.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/13_Magic_System/Unified Symbol Magic/Indexes/Index - All Notes.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 22:01:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Index - Characters]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dataview: No results to show for list query.Dataview: No results to show for table query.]]></description><link>10_system_rules/13_magic_system/unified-symbol-magic/indexes/index-characters.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/13_Magic_System/Unified Symbol Magic/Indexes/Index - Characters.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 22:01:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Index - Spell Construction]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dataview: No results to show for list query.Dataview: No results to show for table query.]]></description><link>10_system_rules/13_magic_system/unified-symbol-magic/indexes/index-spell-construction.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/13_Magic_System/Unified Symbol Magic/Indexes/Index - Spell Construction.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 22:01:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Index - Mechanics]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dataview: No results to show for list query.Dataview: No results to show for table query.]]></description><link>10_system_rules/13_magic_system/unified-symbol-magic/indexes/index-mechanics.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/13_Magic_System/Unified Symbol Magic/Indexes/Index - Mechanics.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 22:01:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Index - Nouns]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dataview: No results to show for list query.Dataview: No results to show for table query.]]></description><link>10_system_rules/13_magic_system/unified-symbol-magic/indexes/index-nouns.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/13_Magic_System/Unified Symbol Magic/Indexes/Index - Nouns.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 22:01:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Index - Verbs]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dataview: No results to show for list query.Dataview: No results to show for table query.]]></description><link>10_system_rules/13_magic_system/unified-symbol-magic/indexes/index-verbs.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/13_Magic_System/Unified Symbol Magic/Indexes/Index - Verbs.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 22:01:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[00 - Overview]]></title><description><![CDATA[A flexible, cinematic magic system for GURPS inspired by Symbol Magic,

Hunter Gear: Firearms, armor, drones, explosives Limited-use technomagical gear Adept-compatible rune items Gates are self-contained environments
Monsters do not retreat outside the Gate unless a break occurs
Clearing the boss collapses the Gate
Time distortion is possible (GM tool)
Advancement Style: Points awarded after Gate clears Milestone bonuses for bosses and discoveries Rare advantages unlocked via artifacts or awakening

You must choose a specific target. You can’t aim at something that you can’t see or otherwise detect.Specify the weapon you’re aiming with and your target. If you follow an Aim maneuver with an Attack or All- Out Attack with the same weapon against the same target, you get a bonus to hit. Add the weapon’s Accuracy (Acc) to your skill, plus any bonuses for targeting systems used: sights, targeting computers, etc.If you brace a firearm or crossbow, you get an extra +1 to Acc. A firearm or crossbow is braced if you can rest it on a sandbag, low wall, car, etc. A onehanded firearm (e.g., a pistol) is considered braced if used two-handed. A two-handed firearm (e.g., a rifle) is considered braced if you are prone and using a bipod.If you Aim for more than one second, you receive an additional bonus: +1 for two seconds of Aim, or +2 for three or more seconds.Your combined bonus from all targeting systems (scopes, sights, computers, etc.) cannot exceed the weapon’s base Accuracy. For instance, if you add a telescopic sight that gives +4 Acc to a pistol with Acc 2, the bonus is +2, not +4.Movement: Step. Exception: You cannot step if using a braced, twohanded weapon.Active Defense: Any, but you automatically spoil your aim and lose all accumulated benefits. If you are injured while aiming, you must make a Will roll or lose your aim.]]></description><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-campaigns/chapter-11-combat/maneuvers/aim.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Campaigns/Chapter 11 Combat/Maneuvers/Aim.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[All-Out Attack]]></title><description><![CDATA[Attack any foe with a ready weapon, making no effort to defend against enemy attacks. If you are making a melee attack, you must specify one of these four options before you attack:• Determined: Make a single attack at +4 to hit!•Double: Make two attacks against the same foe, if you have two ready weapons or one weapon that does not have to be readied after use. Attacks with a second weapon held in the off hand are at the usual -4 (see Handedness, p. 14) unless you have Ambidexterity (p. 39).•Feint: Make one Feint (see above) and then one attack against the same foe. The Feint applies to this attack instead of one you make on your next turn.• Strong: Make a single attack, at normal skill. If you hit, you get +2 to damage – or +1 damage per die, if that would be better. This only applies to melee attacks doing ST-based thrust or swing damage, not to weapons such as force swords.If you are making a ranged attack, you must specify one of these two options before you attack:• Determined: Make a single attack at +1 to hit.• Suppression Fire: Take the entire turn to spray an area with automatic fire. This is a full-turn maneuver, and you can only choose this option if your weapon has RoF 5+. See Suppression Fire (p. 409).Movement: You may move up to half your Move, but you can only move forward.Active Defense: You may make no active defenses at all from the point you take this maneuver until your next turn. If someone attacks you after you make an All-Out attack, all you can do is hope he misses – you can’t dodge, parry, or block!]]></description><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-campaigns/chapter-11-combat/maneuvers/all-out-attack.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Campaigns/Chapter 11 Combat/Maneuvers/All-Out Attack.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[All-Out Defense]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is the maneuver to choose when you’re beset by foes – especially foes who like All-Out Attacks!

You cannot Feint someone unless you could have hit him with a melee attack – that is, your weapon is ready and your foe is within reach. This maneuver is not an attack, though, and does not make your weapon unready.When you Feint, roll a Quick Contest of Melee Weapon skills with your foe; if either of you is unarmed, you may roll against an unarmed combat skill instead. Your opponent may opt to roll against Cloak or Shield skill, if he is suitably equipped and this would give him a better roll. If his DX is better than his combat skills, he may roll against DX instead.If you fail your roll, your Feint is unsuccessful. Likewise, if you succeed, but your foe succeeds by as much as or more than you do, your Feint fails.If you make your roll, and your foe fails, subtract your margin of success from the foe’s active defense if you attack him with Attack, All-Out Attack, or Move and Attack on your next turn. For instance, if your skill is 15 and you roll a 12, your foe defends against you at -3 next turn.If you and your foe both succeed, but you succeed by more, subtract your margin of victory from the foe’s defense. For instance, if your skill is 15 and you roll a 10 (success by 5), and your foe’s skill is 14 and he rolls 12 (success by 2), you win by 3, so he will defend at -3 if your next maneuver is to attack him.You cannot Feint if your foe is unable to observe you! However, if your foe runs away, turns his back on you, or loses sight of you in some way after you successfully Feint, he will still suffer his defense penalty if you attack him on your next turn. If you lose track of the foe, or cannot attack him next turn, your foe’s defense penalty vanishes.A Feint is good for one second! But if you Feint and then make an All-Out Attack (Double), the feint applies to both attacks.In all cases, your allies cannot take advantage of your Feint. The defense penalty applies only to your next attack.Shield Feints: After you have attacked your foe once by striking with your shield (see p. 406), you may also Feint with your shield, rolling against Shield skill.Movement: Step.Active Defense: Any. However, if you Feint and then parry with an unbalanced weapon, you cannot attack on your next turn, making your Feint pointless.]]></description><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-campaigns/chapter-11-combat/maneuvers/feint.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Campaigns/Chapter 11 Combat/Maneuvers/Feint.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Move]]></title><description><![CDATA[Move, but take no other action except those specified under Free Actions. You may move any number of yards up to your full Move score. Most other maneuvers allow at least some movement on your turn; take this maneuver if all you want to do is move. Players must tell the GM exactly where their PCs move to so that he can keep track of the combat. The GM decides where his NPCs move, and will inform any players whose PCs are in a position to witness the movement.If you are controlling a vehicle or riding a mount, take a Move maneuver to spend the turn actively controlling it. Instead of you moving, the vehicle or mount moves on your turn (carrying you and other occupants). See Mounted Combat and Vehicles for details.Sprinting: If you run forward for two or more turns in a row, you get bonus movement on your second and later moves; see Sprinting.Movement: See above.Active Defense: Any.]]></description><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-campaigns/chapter-11-combat/maneuvers/move.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Campaigns/Chapter 11 Combat/Maneuvers/Move.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Wait]]></title><description><![CDATA[Do nothing unless a particular event you specified in advance occurs before your next turn; e.g., a foe moves into range. If that happens, you may transform your Wait into an Attack, Feint, All-Out Attack (you must specify the option before acting), or Ready maneuver. If you are reacting to someone else, this interrupts his turn, but he can resume it after you’ve acted.You must specify exactly what your action will be when you take the Wait maneuver, and what will trigger it. For instance, “I’ll make an All-Out Attack (Determined) with my sword on the first orc to move toward me.”You may take a Wait with a ready ranged weapon; this is known as “covering” a target or area. If so, you must specify the zone that you are covering with that weapon. There is no penalty to cover a one-yard area. For larger areas and additional rules, see Opportunity Fire (p. 390).You can use the Wait maneuver for any “reflex action” you want to plan in advance, provided you specify both the response and the action that will trigger it. This can include holding a knife at a hostage’s throat, or even a noncombat action (e.g., “If Dora sees any orcs, she will pull this rope immediately – otherwise, she does nothing.”). An action only qualifies as a “reflex” if you could do it in a single motion. The GM’s decision is final.Finally, you can use Wait to coordinate actions with slower friends.Stop Thrust: If you have a ready thrusting weapon, you can use a Wait to brace your weapon to receive a possible enemy charge. Simply state, “I brace for a stop thrust.” You can convert your Wait into an Attack or All-Out Attack against any one foe that moves one or more yards toward you to make a melee attack (armed or unarmed, including a slam or a grapple) or evade (see Evading, p. 368). You strike first if you have the longer reach. If you hit and your foe fails to defend, add +1 to thrust damage for every two full yards your attacker moved toward you. Movement: None until your Wait is triggered. At that point, you may move as allowed by the maneuver you specified (Attack, Feint, All-Out Attack, or Ready).Active Defense: You may defend normally while you are waiting or after your Wait is triggered. But if you defend while taking a Wait, you may not transform your Wait into an All- Out Attack; you must convert your Wait into an Attack instead. ]]></description><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-campaigns/chapter-11-combat/maneuvers/wait.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Campaigns/Chapter 11 Combat/Maneuvers/Wait.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Grapple Cheat Sheet]]></title><description><![CDATA[Grappling your foe (to gain a superior fighting position)
Move into close combat.
To grapple Torso Roll against grappling skill to hit (you may evaluate or feint if you wish).
To grapple a Hit Location apply half usual penalty to hit.
You get a +2 for every arm after the first 2, no difference between using 1 or 2 arms to grapple.
Foe defends normally (dodge, block, or parry), unless you started the turn in close combat – then he cannot block, and can only parry with a reach C weapon (he can still dodge).
If he successfully parries with a weapon, he rolls against his weapon skill and if he succeeds does automatic damage to your grappling limb.
(Torso, Neck, and Head) foe is now at a -4 to DX which mean a -4 to all attacks, -2 to parry and block, and -1 to dodge
(Arms, Legs, Hands, and Feet) foe is now at a -4 to DX with that hit location. So grappling an arm would give -4 to all attacks with it, and -2 to parries or blocks with it. To Break Free
Your foe must win a Quick contest of ST to break free from your grapple. You get a +5 if using both hands. Moves and Techniques after Grapple is established
You cannot: [B371]
Aim, Feint, Concentrate, Wait, or make ranged attacks (unless your foe is pinned). Your foe cannot: [B371]
Aim, Feint, Concentrate, Wait, or make ranged attacks (they are all impossible). 3rd Parties Striking Grapplers [B392]
A 3rd party striking a grappler has a -2 to hit. If they miss, they could hit the other grappler, or someone else in close combat in that hex. Roll randomly to determine who. They then roll to hit against a 9, or the number to have hit that person on purpose, whichever is worse. If they miss, they keep rolling until they have run out of targets in that hex, or they hit someone. (Torso) Takedown [B370]
On a standing foe roll you ST, DX, or grappling skill vs your foes ST, DX, or grappling skill.
You take a penalty to your roll equal to the usual penalty to hit for your posture.
The loser falls down into the winner’s hex and an adjacent hex of the winner’s choice. If the loser was grappling the winner, he loses his grip and is free from the grapple. (Torso) Pin [B370]
If your foe is on the ground, roll a regular contest of ST.
To win, you must succeed, and he must fail.
Larger fighter gets +3 per size modifier.
The fighter with the most free hands, gets +3 (Hands grappling the torso count as free).
If you used 2 hands to pin your foe, you may release one after you pin him.
If pinned, your foe cannot take any maneuver that takes physical movement.
To Break Free:
Your foe must win a quick contest of your ST+5 vs his ST to break free from your pin.
You get an additional +5 if using two hands.
If you are stunned, you roll at a -4.
You each get +2 for every arm after the first 2. (Arm) Force Foe to Drop Weapon [B370]
You must have grappled your foe’s weapon arm or hand.
Roll a regular contest of ST.
If you win you foe drops his weapon.
If you lose (your foes wins) he breaks his hand or arm free from your grapple. (Neck) Choke or Strangle (no judo or wrestling) [B370]
You must have grappled your foe by the neck.
Roll a quick contest of your ST+3 vs your foe’s ST or HT.
You are at a -5 if only using one hand.
You get a +2 for each hand after the first.
If you win, your foe takes crushing damage to the neck (x 1.5 because it is the neck)
Foe starts to suffocate. On the next turn, and every turn until he escapes, he loses 1 FP.
To Break Free:
Just like normal 2 handed grapple; a quick contest of ST. You get a +5 for using both hands. (Neck) Choke Hole (with Judo or Wrestling) [MA 69]
Attack from behind at Judo -2 or Wrestling -3. Extra -1 if attacking from the front.
Foe defends normally from the front.
If you surprise attack from behind, and your foe doesn’t get a defense, he can still duck his chin and parry at a -2 with a grappling skill.
If he succeeds, you still grapple his neck, but aren’t choking him.
If he critically succeeds, you fail to grapple him at all.
Next turn; roll a quick contest of your ST+3 vs your foe’s ST or HT.
You are at a -5 if only using one hand.
You get get a +2 for each hand after the first.
If you win, your foe takes crushing damage to the neck (x 1.5 because it is the neck). Or Fatigue damage (carotid choke).

To Break Free:
Roll a quick contest of your ST+4 vs your foe’s ST. If he loses, he has a cumulative -1 on future attempts.
Next and Following Turns
As a free action, roll a quick contest of your ST, Judo, Wrestling, or Arm Lock vs your foe’s ST or HT.
You inflict crushing damage equal to your margin of victory to your foes arm.
If you cripple his arm, you may not inflict further injury, but he will suffer shock and stunning as though you had.
Rigid DR protects normal, flexible DR has no effect.
Your opponent defends at a -4 due to the lock.

He can attack you with a Wild Swing (p. 388), Back Kick (p. 230), etc., at the usual -4 for being grappled.On your next turn – and on each turn thereafter, until your foe breaks free – your victim loses 1 FP, per Suffocation (p. 436).

Fright Checks can occur as often or as rarely as the GM wishes. In a horror campaign where ordinary people meet shockingly gruesome Things, Fright Checks might be very common! With only minor adaptation, the GM can use these rules for awe, confusion, etc. as well as fear. As a general rule, “ordinary” frightening things do not require Fright Checks. Fright Checks are for events so unusual and terrifying that they might stun or even permanently scar someone.What counts as “ordinary” depends on the characters and the setting. This is one place where a character story can be helpful! An ordinary, 21st-century American might have to make Fright Checks for encounters with monsters, dead bodies, and the supernatural. A battle-hardened commando in the same game might not have to roll for dead bodies. And in a fantasy campaign, all these things may be quite normal . . . threatening, but normal. On the other hand, a fantasy character might have to make a Fright Check if transported to the 21st century and given a ride down the interstate . . .]]></description><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-campaigns/fright-checks/fright-checks.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Campaigns/Fright Checks/Fright Checks.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rule of 14]]></title><description><![CDATA[If final, modified Will exceeds 13, reduce it to 13 for the purpose of the Fright Check.

This is called “knockback.” Only crushing and cutting attacks can cause knockback. A crushing attack can cause knockback regardless of whether it penetrates DR. A cutting attack can cause knockback only if it fails to penetrate DR. Knockback depends on basic damage rolled before subtracting DR. For every full multiple of the target’s ST-2 rolled, move the target one yard away from the attacker. For instance, a man with ST 10 would be knocked back one yard per full 8 points of basic damage. If the target has ST 3 or less, knockback is one yard per point of basic damage! If the target has no ST score at all (like a wall), or is not resisting, use its HP instead. Anyone who suffers knockback must attempt a roll against the highest of DX, Acrobatics, or Judo. If he is knocked back more than one yard, he rolls at -1 per yard after the first. Perfect Balance (p. 74) gives +4 to this roll. On a failure, he falls down. If you knock your foe into something solid, the result – including damage to him and whatever he hit – is as if he had collided with it at a speed equal to the yards of knockback. See Collisions and Falls (p. 430). “Knockback Only”: Some attacks – a jet of water, a shove (p. 372), etc. – do knockback but no damage. Roll the listed damage and work out knockback as usual, but no actual injury occurs (unless the target collides with something!).]]></description><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-campaigns/knockback.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Campaigns/Knockback.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Surprise Attacks and Initiative]]></title><description><![CDATA[When the PCs surprise a group of adversaries, or vice versa, the surprised party may not be able to react immediately. In this case, the attackers should get one or more “free turns.” The GM is responsible for determining when the attackers have achieved surprise.A character with Combat Reflexes is rarely surprised, and will never “freeze.” He also gets +6 on all IQ rolls to recover from surprise. Note that many wild animals have Combat Reflexes – see Chapter 16 for examples.Total SurpriseWhen the defenders are taken completely by surprise, they “freeze.” The GM rolls 1d. This is the number of seconds that pass before the defenders can react at all. Until that time is up, they are mentally stunned and must take the Do Nothing maneuver. Exception: Those with Combat Reflexes never freeze, and treat total surprise as partial surprise.Adventurers, guards, etc. rarely suffer total surprise unless they are actually asleep. But total surprise would be appropriate if a group of werewolves came charging through the door of the local library. (In fact, such an extreme case might justify a Fright Check – at least for the librarian.)After the initial “freeze” ends, each defender must roll against his basic IQ at the start of his turn until he recovers. On a success, he must take Do Nothing that turn, but can act normally for the rest of the combat. On a failure, he is still mentally stunned; he may roll again at the start of his next turn. A low-IQ character, taken totally by surprise, could miss the whole combat!Partial SurpriseThis may occur when the defenders were expecting trouble . . . or when each party surprised the other! The GM should require each side to roll for initiative.To determine who gets the initiative, the leader of each side rolls 1d. A leader with Combat Reflexes gets +2, or +1 if he doesn’t have Combat Reflexes but someone else on his side does (this bonus is not cumulative for more than one character). The leader with the higher IQ gets +1. Having even one point in Tactics skill gives +1 on initiative rolls; Tactics at level 20+ gives +2. The GM can apply other modifiers as he sees fit; e.g., if he thinks one side was more alert than the other.If one side is totally leaderless, the GM rolls for them. They get an automatic -2 to initiative. (This does not apply to animals or any other group with IQ 5 or less.)The side that gets the highest roll gets the initiative, and can move and act normally. Everyone on the other side is mentally stunned, and must make IQ rolls on their turns, as described for total surprise, to snap out of it. However, with partial surprise, there is a +1 bonus to IQ on the second turn, +2 on the third turn, and so on . . . even low IQ characters catch on after a few seconds. Note that animals often have Combat Reflexes, which counteracts their low IQ.If the initiative roll is a tie, nobody was taken by surprise.]]></description><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-campaigns/surprise-attacks-and-initiative.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Campaigns/Surprise Attacks and Initiative.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[360° Vision]]></title><description><![CDATA[You have a 360° field of vision.

Specify how this works when you buy the advantage: entangling your victim in vines, tying him up with webs, freezing him inside a block of ice, turning the ground to quicksand beneath his feet, etc. Binding is a ranged attack with 1/2D –, Max 100, Acc 3, RoF 1, Shots N/A, and Recoil 1. You can add modifiers to change these statistics (see pp. 101-116).On a hit, your victim is grappled (see p. 370) and rooted in place. He cannot select the Move or Change Posture maneuvers or change facing, and is at -4 to DX. The ST of this effect is equal to your Binding level, but you can layer additional attacks on a successfully bound victim. Each extra layer gives +1 to ST.To break free, the victim must win a Quick Contest of ST or Escape skill against the ST of your Binding. Each attempt takes one second. If the victim fails to break free, he loses 1 FP but may try again. Alternatively, he may try to destroy the Binding. Innate Attacks hit automatically; other attacks are at -4. External attacks on the Binding take no penalty, but risk hitting the victim on a miss (see Striking Into a Close Combat, p. 392). The Binding has DR equal to 1/3 your level (rounded down). Each point of damage reduces ST by one. At ST 0, the Binding is destroyed and the victim is freed.To simulate vines, webs, and so forth, add one or more of Area Effect (p. 102), Persistent (p. 107), and Wall (p. 109) – and possibly some of the special modifiers below.Special EnhancementsEngulfing: Your attack pins the target. He cannot move his limbs or speak; his only options are to use purely mental abilities, to attack the Binding with an Innate Attack, or to try to break free using ST (not Escape skill). If he tries to break free and fails, he is only allowed a repeated attempt every 10 seconds – and on a 17 or 18, he becomes so entangled that he cannot escape on his own! +60%.Only Damaged By X: Only specific damage types can damage your Binding. +30% for one of burning, corrosion, crushing, or cutting; +20% for any two; +10% for any three.Sticky: Your Binding is treated as Persistent (p. 107), but only affects those who actually touch the original target of your attack. +20%. Unbreakable: Your Binding cannot be destroyed. The only way to escape is to break free. +40%.Special LimitationsEnvironmental: Your Binding manipulates an existing condition or object in the environment, and won’t work in its absence. This is worth from -20% (victim must be touching the ground) to -40% (victim must be standing in dense vegetation), at the GM’s option.One-Shot: You cannot layer your Binding to increase its ST. -10%.]]></description><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/advantages/binding.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Advantages/Binding.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Combat Reflexes]]></title><description><![CDATA[You have extraordinary reactions, and are rarely surprised for more than a moment.

Subtract this from the damage done by any physical or energy attack after the DR of artificial armor (you can normally wear armor over natural DR) but before multiplying the injury for damage type. By default, natural DR does not protect your eyes (or windows, if you are a vehicle) or help against purely mental attacks, such as telepathy.Normal humans cannot purchase DR at all. Creatures with natural armor can buy DR 1 to 5. Thick skin or a pelt would be DR 1; pig hide, armadillo shell, a heavy pelt, or scales like those of a lizard would be DR 2; rhinoceros hide or a pangolin’s armor plates would be DR 3; alligator scales or elephant hide would be DR 4; and a giant tortoise would have DR 5.

Each point of DR stops one point of damage and turns it into one character point that you can use to improve traits (anything but skills) temporarily. You store these points in a “battery” with capacity equal to DR (e.g., DR 10 gives a 10-point battery). Once this battery is full, each point of DR will still stop one point of damage, but will not convert it into a character point. You do not have to use stored points immediately, but you cannot reallocate points once used. You lose absorbed points – unused ones first – at the rate of one point per second. You lose enhanced abilities as the points drain away. (Exception: If you are missing HP or FP, you can heal yourself. Restoring one HP drains 2 stored points immediately; restoring one FP drains 3 points. Such healing is permanent. Only HP or FP in excess of your usual scores drain away.) You cannot absorb damage from your own ST or attack abilities. +80% if absorbed points can only enhance one trait (determined when you create your character) or can only heal; +100% if you can raise any trait.Force Field: Your DR takes the form of a field projected a short distance from your body. This protects your entire body – including your eyes – as well as anything you are carrying, and reduces the damage from attacks before armor DR. Effects that rely on touch (such as many magic spells) only affect you if carried by an attack that does enough damage to pierce your DR. +20%.Hardened: Each level of Hardened reduces the armor divisor of an attack by one step. These steps are, in order: “ignores DR,” 100, 10, 5, 3, 2, and 1 (no divisor). +20% per level.Reflection: Your DR “bounces back” any damage it stops at your attacker. The remaining damage affects you normally. The attacker doesn’t get an active defense against the first attack you reflect back at him, but gets his usual defenses against subsequent reflected attacks. Reflection only works vs. direct hits! It cannot reflect damage from explosions, fragments, poison gas, or anything else that affects an entire area. This enhancement is mutually exclusive with Absorption. +100%.Special LimitationsAblative: Your DR stops damage once. Each point of DR stops one point of basic damage but is destroyed in the process. Lost DR “heals” at the same rate as lost HP (including the effects of Regeneration, p. 80). Use this to represent supers who can absorb massive punishment but who lack the mass to justify a large HP score. -80%.Can’t Wear Armor: Your body is designed in such a way that you cannot or will not wear body armor or clothing. -40%.Directional: Your DR only protects against attacks from one direction. -20% for the front (F); -40% for the back (B), right (R), left (L), top (T), or underside (U). Humanoids may only take this limitation for front and back.Flexible: Your DR is not rigid. This leaves you vulnerable to blunt trauma (see p. 379). -20%.Limited: Your DR applies only to certain attack forms or damage types. See Limited Defenses (box) for details. Partial: Your DR only protects a specific hit location. This is worth -10% per -1 penalty to hit that body part (see p. 398). For instance, an animal with butting horns and a thick skull might have “Skull only,” for -70%. “Torso only” is -10%, and also protects the vital organs. When you take this limitation for arms, legs, hands, or feet, the DR protects all limbs of that type. If it only protects one limb, the limitation value doubles (e.g., arms are -2 to hit, so a single arm would be -40%). If you have arms, legs, etc. with different penalties, use the least severe penalty to calculate limitation value.Semi-Ablative: When an attack strikes semi-ablative DR, every 10 points of basic damage rolled removes one point of DR, regardless of whether the attack penetrates DR. Lost DR “heals” as for Ablative (and you cannot combine the two). -20%.
Tough Skin: By default, Damage Resistance is “hard”: armor plate, chitin, etc. With this limitation, your DR is merely tough skin. Any effect that requires a scratch (e.g., poison) or skin contact (e.g., electrical shock or Pressure Points skill) affects you if the attack carrying it penetrates the DR of any armor you are wearing – even if it does exactly 0 damage! Your natural DR, being living tissue, provides no protection at all against such attacks. This limitation includes all the effects of the Flexible limitation (see above); you cannot take both. It is mutually incompatible with Force Field. -40%. “Layered” Defenses
You may have multiple “layers” of DR with different combinations of modifiers. You must specify the order of the layers – from outermost to innermost – when you create your character. You may not change this order once set.]]></description><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/advantages/damage-resistance.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Advantages/Damage Resistance.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Elemental Meta-Traits]]></title><description><![CDATA[VariableYour body is wholly composed of a particular substance.

If this bonus makes the difference between success and failure, you collapse, apparently dead (or disabled), but come to in the usual amount of time – see Recovering from Unconsciousness (p. 423). A successful Diagnosis roll (or a Mechanic roll, for machines) reveals the truth.Example: Bruno has HT 12, 15 HP, and Hard to Kill 4. He takes 45 points of damage, which reduces him to -30 HP. He must make two HT rolls to survive: one at -15 HP, one at -30 HP. He rolls an 11 for the first one, but on the second roll, he gets a 14. This is above his HT (12), but below his modifiedHT (12 + 4 = 16). He passes out, and his foes leave him for dead.

There are three progressively more “cinematic” levels of Luck:Luck: Once per hour of play, you may reroll a single bad die roll twice and take the best of the three rolls! You must declare that you are using your Luck immediately after you roll the dice. Once you or anyone else has made another die roll, it is too late to use Luck. If the GM is rolling in secret (e.g., to see if you notice something), you may tell him you are using your Luck ahead of time, and he must roll three times and give you the best result. 15 points.Extraordinary Luck: As above, but usable every 30 minutes. 30 points.Ridiculous Luck: As above, but usable every 10 minutes! 60 points. Your Luck only applies to your own success, damage, or reaction rolls, or on outside events that affect you or your whole party, or when you are being attacked (in which case you may make the attacker roll three times and take the worst roll!).You cannot share Luck. If Strong Sam is trying to kick open a door, Lucky Lou can’t stand behind him and transfer his Luck. He’ll have to kick that door himself.Once you use Luck, you must wait an hour of real time (30 minutes for Extraordinary Luck, 10 minutes for Ridiculous Luck) before using it again. You cannot use Luck at 11:58 and then again at 12:01. And you cannot save up Luck.

This advantage comes in levels. You must purchase Magery 0 before buying higher levels of Magery.Magery 0: This is basic “magical awareness,” a prerequisite for learning magic in most worlds. The GM makes a Sense roll (p. 358) when you first see a magic item, and again when you first touch it. On a success, you intuitively know that the item is magical. A roll of 3 or 4 also tells you whether the magic is helpful or dangerous, and about how strong it is. Those without Magery do not get this roll! 5 points.Magery 1+: Higher levels of Magery make it much easier to learn and use magic. Add your Magery to IQ when you learn spells. For instance, if you have IQ 14, Magery 3 lets you learn spells as if you had IQ 17. Add your Magery level to Perception when you roll to sense magic items, and to IQ when you learn <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaumatology (IQ-7_)" data-href="Thaumatology (IQ-7_)" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaumatology</a> skill.Reduce the time required to learn new spells in play (but not the point cost) by 10% per Magery level, to a minimum of 60% of the usual time at Magery 4. For instance, with Magery 3, you would learn spells in 70% the usual time. <br>Powerful spells require a minimum level of Magery as a prerequisite, so be sure to skim the Spell List (pp. 242- 253) when deciding how much Magery you need. Note that high Magery lets you produce powerful results with even the most basic spells; see <a data-href="Magery and Effect" href="10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/magic-(chapter-5)/magery-and-effect.html" class="internal-link data-link-icon data-link-icon-after data-link-text" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-link-path="10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Magic (Chapter 5)/Magery and Effect.md" style="--data-link-path: 10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Magic (Chapter 5)/Magery and Effect.md;" data-link-tags="">Magery and Effect</a>. The GM sets the maximum Magery allowed to PCs. Magery 3 is about right for “classic fantasy.” 10 points/level (on top of the 5 points for Magery 0).The use of Magery becomes tricky in nonmagical backgrounds. You still have the ability to sense magic, but until you gain experience with magic, the GM should not say, “That idol is magical,” but, “That idol looks very strange to you, very sinister. You sense there is something special about it.” If you are from a nonmagical culture, you do not start with any spells, but you can still learn magic if you find an opportunity. When you enter a magical world, those who can detect your aura recognize you as a potential magic-user. How they react depends on the setting. Magery 0 costs 5 points for all mages, but you may apply one of the limitations below to the 10 points/level for Magery 1+. Limited Magery is sometimes known as “aspected Magery.”Dance: You must be free to use bodily motions in order to cast spells. You are not freed from rituals requiring movement as your spell level increases (see Magic Rituals, p. 237). However, you need not speak at all to cast your spells. -40%. Dark-Aspected: You can only use your powers in darkness. Regardless of the time of day or night, any light greater than candlelight or starlight deprives you of your abilities, though your aura reveals that you are a mage. -50%. Day-Aspected: You can use your powers only when the sun is in the sky – on average, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. During solar eclipses, you have no powers! The effects of other astronomical events are up to the GM. When the sun is down, you have none of your magical abilities, although a look at your aura reveals that you are a mage. You are not affected by being in buildings, underground, and so on; only the sun’s position matters. You know automatically (if you are awake) when it is one minute to sunrise and one minute to sunset. -40%.Musical: You must use a musical instrument in order to cast spells. You can never cast spells silently. -50%. Night-Aspected: You can only use your powers when the sun is not in the sky – on average, from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. When the sun is up, you have none of your magical abilities, although a look at your aura reveals that you are a mage. You are not affected by being in buildings, underground, and so on; only the sun’s position matters. You know automatically (if you are awake) when it is one minute to sunrise and one minute to sunset. -40%. One College Only: Your Magery only benefits the spells of a single college and the Recover Energy spell (p. 248). You learn other spells as though you were a nonmage, and can only cast them in high-mana areas. You may still count such spells as prerequisites for spells in your own college. You cannot detect magic items unless they contain at least one spell of your college, in which case you roll normally for detection on first sight and first touch. -40%. Solitary: Your magical abilities are at -3 for every sapient being within five yards of you, and -6 for anyone touching you. As partial compensation, you get a roll vs. IQ to notice any time a sapient creature enters or leaves the five-yard area around you – but this only works on a single person. If there is already someone standing next to you, you won’t notice if someone else approaches. -40%. Song: You must be able to sing in order to cast your spells. You are not freed from the ritual of speaking to cast spells as your spell level increases (see Magic Rituals, p. 237). -40%.]]></description><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/advantages/magery.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Advantages/Magery.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Damage and Injury]]></title><description><![CDATA[If your attack roll succeeds and your target fails his defense roll (if any), you may make a damage roll.

In the real world, we regard such traits as <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Advantages" data-href="Advantages" href="10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/advantages/advantages.html" class="internal-link data-link-icon data-link-icon-after data-link-text" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-link-tags="" data-link-path="10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Advantages/Advantages.md" style="--data-link-path: 10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Advantages/Advantages.md;">advantages</a> ! Their disadvantage value in GURPS comes from the fact that these virtues limit your freedom of action. For instance, someone with Truthfulness will have trouble lying, even for a good cause; therefore, within the framework of the game, he has a disadvantage. This has one very worthwhile benefit: if you want to create a wholly heroic character, you don't have to take any "character flaws" at all. You can get points by choosing only those disadvantages that are actually virtuous!Tragic FlawsMany of the greatest heroes of history and literature had a "tragic flaw." Alcoholism, great ugliness, bad temper, compulsive behavior, and even drug addiction - all are found in the heroes of fact and fiction. So don't assume that your heroes have to be perfect . . . try giving them significant problems to overcome.​Your GM might wish to "cap" the extra points you can gain from disadvantages; see Disadvantage Limit (p. 11). This limit applies to the total points you can get from all traits with negative point costs, from Chapter 1 (reduced attributes, low Status, etc.) or the list below. Mandatory disadvantages assigned by the GM don't count against this limit. Most GMs will want to enforce two additional restrictions:<br>Negated Disadvantages: You cannot take a disadvantage that one of your <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Advantages" data-href="Advantages" href="10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/advantages/advantages.html" class="internal-link data-link-icon data-link-icon-after data-link-text" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-link-tags="" data-link-path="10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Advantages/Advantages.md" style="--data-link-path: 10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Advantages/Advantages.md;">advantages</a> would mitigate or negate! For instance, if you have Acute Hearing, you cannot take Hard of Hearing. Contradictory disadvantages, such as Curious and Incurious, are also mutually exclusive. The GM has the final say as to which traits are compatible.Villain Disadvantages: Some disadvantages - Sadism, for instance - are not at all suitable for a "hero," and the GM is free to forbid them to PCs. But they are often found in the more fiendish villains of&nbsp;adventure fiction, so they are included in the interest of good NPC creation.Secret Disadvantages You may give your character a disadvantage unknown both to him and to you. Choose a point value and tell the GM. The GM will select a disadvantage and give you its value plus an additional -5 points (e.g., Unluckiness, normally worth -10 points, gives -15 points as a secret disadvantage) . . . but he will not give you any hints as to what it is! When your disadvantage finally becomes obvious in the course of play (GM's decision), you must buy off the extra -5 points as soon as possible. The GM must pick a secret disadvantage carefully. It should be something that you could believably not know about. If it is a mental disadvantage, the conditions that trigger it should never have arisen (Berserk, Bloodlust, Combat Paralysis, the less-common Phobias, and Split Personality all work well here). Most physical disadvantages are too obvious - although something like Hemophilia might go unnoticed. You can only list one secret disadvantage on your character sheet, but this might represent more than one trait. The GM is free to select multiple, related disadvantages worth the appropriate number of points.

Each trick requires a separate skill roll, at whatever penalties the GM sees fit. If you are performing stunts on a moving vehicle or mount, roll against the lower of Acrobatics and the appropriate Driving or Riding skill.You may substitute an Acrobatics roll for a DX roll in any attempt to jump, roll, avoid falling down, etc. As well, you may attempt an Acrobatic Dodge in combat – a jump or roll that avoids an attack in a flashy way (see Acrobatic Dodge, p. 375). Finally, a successful Acrobatics roll will reduce the effective distance of any fall by five yards (see Falling, p. 431).Two special versions of Acrobatics are also available:Aerobatics: The ability to execute tight turns, loops, power dives, etc. in flight. You must be able to fly to learn this skill – although how you fly (magic, wings, jet pack, etc.) is irrelevant. Natural fliers might find flight to be as effortless as humans find walking, but they must still learn Aerobatics in order to engage in complex acrobatics. Add +2 to skill if you have 3D Spatial Sense (p. 34).Aquabatics: The ability to engage in underwater acrobatics. Prerequisites: Swimming, or the Amphibious advantage (p. 40) or the Aquatic disadvantage (p. 145).Acrobatics, Aerobatics, and Aquabatics default to one another at -4. Add +1 to these three skills if you have Perfect Balance (p. 74).]]></description><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/skills/acrobatics.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Skills/Acrobatics.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alchemy]]></title><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/skills/alchemy.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Skills/Alchemy.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Armoury]]></title><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/skills/armoury.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Skills/Armoury.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Body Sense]]></title><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/skills/body-sense.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Skills/Body Sense.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Brawling]]></title><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/skills/brawling.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Skills/Brawling.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Climbing]]></title><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/skills/climbing.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Skills/Climbing.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Connoisseur]]></title><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/skills/connoisseur.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Skills/Connoisseur.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Escape]]></title><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/skills/escape.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Skills/Escape.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Forced Entry]]></title><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/skills/forced-entry.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Skills/Forced Entry.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Forgery]]></title><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/skills/forgery.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Skills/Forgery.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Heraldry]]></title><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/skills/heraldry.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Skills/Heraldry.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hidden Lore†]]></title><description><![CDATA[IQ/AverageDefaults: None.This skill represents knowledge that is lost, deliberately hidden, or simply neglected.

If you wish to enter play with Hidden Lore skills, you must account for this specific knowledge in your character story. The GM might even require you to purchase an Unusual Background before you can learn Hidden Lore skills. Of course, the GM is also free to forbid Hidden Lore skills to starting characters . . . or to PCs in general!To acquire Hidden Lore in play, you must find a reliable source of relevant information. The GM may choose to tie skill increases in Hidden Lore to specific acts – such as reading moldy tomes – instead of allowing you to spend points freely. For instance, an ancient manuscript might let you spend up to eight points (and no more) on a specific Hidden Lore skill.Remember that most Hidden Lore is secret because somebody powerful wants it kept that way. Thus, discussing or revealing your knowledge can be extremely hazardous. Possible Hidden Lore specialties include:Conspiracies: You know details about the conspiracies that underlie every aspect of society. This is factual knowledge (e.g., truths about the Illuminati), not the ability to analyze conspiracies. Only available in settings where vast conspiracies really do exist.Demon Lore: You know the secrets of Hell, the goals of demons in the mortal world, and possibly even the names of specific demons.Faerie Lore: You have detailed knowledge of the faeries and their secret kingdom(s).Spirit Lore: You know about ghosts and other spirit entities – names, motivations, etc.Lost Civilizations: Knowledge of nations or races that perished eons ago – usually after dabbling in Bad Juju. A successful roll lets you recognize the ruins or relics of such a civilization.Magic Items: Knowledge of legendary, typically named and unique, items of power. A successful roll lets you recognize such an artifact and recall some of its capabilities.Magical Writings: Knowledge of texts weirder than mere spellbooks or scrolls.

Every skill is separate, though some skills help you to learn others. Just as in real life, you start your career with some skills and can learn more if you spend time training. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A number called “skill level” measures your ability with each of your skills: the higher the number, the greater your skill. For instance, “Shortsword-17” means a skill level of 17 with the shortsword. When you try to do something, you (or the GM) roll 3d against the appropriate skill, modified for that particular situation. If the number you roll is less than or equal to your modified score for that skill, you succeed! But a roll of 17 or 18 is an automatic failure. For more on skill rolls, modifiers, success, and failure, see Chapter 10. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Each skill is qualified in several ways to indicate what basic attribute represents talent with that skill, how easy the skill is to learn, any special restrictions on who can learn the skill, and whether the skill is broad or narrow in focus.

When creating a new spell, use the rules for inventing (see Chapter 17), but replace Engineer skill with Thaumatology. A successful skill roll can also identify an unknown spell when you see it cast, deduce the ramifications of a critical success or failure with magic, determine the spells needed to enchant a magic item to perform as desired, etc. The better your roll, the more insight the GM will provide.This is the study of fantasy magic – fireball spells, rings of power, etc. The equivalent skill for traditional, spirit-mediated sorcery is Ritual Magic (p. 218), while holy magic might require Religious Ritual (p. 217) or Theology (p. 226). However, a Thaumatology roll at -5 will allow a thaumatologist to relate these different varieties of magic to “standard” wizardry. Exceptionally weird powers or otherworldly artifacts might give a larger penalty!]]></description><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/skills/thaumatology.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Skills/Thaumatology.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Throwing]]></title><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/skills/throwing.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Skills/Throwing.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Traps (TL)]]></title><description><![CDATA[IQ/AverageDefaults: IQ-5 or Lockpicking-3*.* Also defaults to DX-5 if you are disarming or resetting a trap, but not if you are detecting or building one.This is the skill of building and nullifying traps.

They can plow through many obstacles! The disadvantage is that stealth is impossible – each attempt at the tasks below has a chance of being heard.Bashing: You can destroy a door or a chest with a crushing or cutting weapon. Don’t bother with attack rolls! Roll damage at +2, or +1 per die, for All-Out Attack (Strong) – plus another +1 per die with Forced Entry at DX+1, or +2 per die at DX+2. The GM will subtract DR, multiply by 1.5 if you used a cutting attack, and reduce the target’s HP until it breaks. Swords dislike such abuse, and have a 3 in 6 chance (2 in 6 if fine, 1 in 6 if very fine) of bending: -1 to skill. Crowbars revel in destruction, and deliver swing+2 crushing.Forcing: Another option is to apply boot or shoulder to the door and overpower its attachments without annihilating it. Roll a Quick Contest: ST vs. the lock or hinge’s HP (6 to 46). You may add Lifting ST, +2 for a crowbar, and +1 with Forced Entry at DX+1 or +2 at DX+2, but have a penalty equal to the hardware’s DR (-3 to -24). For a barred or wedged portal, use the bar or wedge’s DR (-1 to -16) as a penalty, if greater than the lock or hinge’s DR; similarly, the portal resists with the bar or wedge’s HP (14 to 37), if higher than the lock or hinge’s HP. You must win to open the door. Repeated attempts have a cumulative -1 and cost 1 FP each.Bending: To pry apart metal bars in a grate or a portcullis, use the rules for forcing. A metal bar gives from -6 to -24 for DR, and has from 12 to 46 HP.Lifting: If the problem is a heavy barrier (fallen lintel, unlocked portcullis, etc.), the solution is to lift it. This is a two-handed lift; use Basic Lift x 8 lbs., figured using ST plus Lifting ST. Add another 5% to BL per point by which you make a Lifting roll.Hiii-yah! For all the feats above, martial artists can make a Breaking Blow roll (-1 for wood, -5 for metal) to divide object DR by 5 and/or a Power Blow roll to double ST.

A Magelock spell can’t be picked – it requires Counterspell or Lockmaster.Doors: If lockpicking fails, the party lacks a thief, or the delvers simply want to break stuff, forced entry becomes an issue; see Muscling Through (p. 8).

You can draw and shoot a bow quickly. To do so, take a Ready maneuver to get an arrow. On your next turn, make a Bow roll at -3 to ready your bow in no time. Failure means you can only ready, but success lets you attack at -3 on the same turn! Both penalties are only -1 if you have Weapon Master (Bow). This trick shaves a second off the usual two-second ready time, letting you shoot every other turn. By making a Fast-Draw (Arrow) roll to ready an arrow instantly before either roll above, you can shoot every turn!You’re also a “natural” with the bow in general. Whenever you Attack or All-Out Attack, add your bow’s Accuracy bonus without taking an Aim maneuver (if you Aim, add another +1 after one second, or +2 after two). When you Move and Attack or are in close combat, ignore your bow’s Bulk penalty instead of adding Acc. Finally, ignore penalties for crazy positions or acrobatics while shooting, and halve similar penalties to Fast-Draw (Arrow).]]></description><link>10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/dungeon-fantasy/heroic-archer.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Dungeon Fantasy/Heroic Archer.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Inextinguishable Power]]></title><description><![CDATA[5 points
Prerequisite: Magery 1+.
Holy casters are relatively safe from power loss – unless they offend their boss – but wizards lack this guarantee. Some dungeons are full of effects intended to disempower mages. You aren’t so easily foiled! You enjoy +5 to resist unwanted Magic Resistance spells, Suspend Magery, and Drain Magery. You may even contest Great Wish spells aimed at ruining your Magery, albeit with straight Will. You also get a Will roll to shrug off anti-Magery traps and potions (like Magebane) that normally allow no resistance.

Each hand can attack unarmed, with a one-handed melee weapon, or with a pistol.

You can attack one target or two – but to strike two foes with melee attacks, they must be adjacent.

Reach C-1.Innate Spellcasting: Only water and knowledge spells. Improvisation up to 8 points, hardcore improvisation up to 63 points. Typically, a weird knows the Divination spell and the [Control Elemental] spell for its native element. Water Pool: A water weird dwells within a large pool filled with bubbling water. The pool must be at least 16 yards across and 6 yards deep. A water weird’s pool may be affixed only to a horizontal surface, and it may appear only in a right side up position (such as on the floor of a cavern). The surface must have sufficient depth to accommodate the pool. An elemental pool can also exist as a separate area inside a larger volume of the same element.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The base of the pool contains a portal to the weird’s native plane. Three times per day, the weird can summon elemental allies through this portal, as if casting [Summon Water Elemental], but summoning a group of up to ten elementals each worth up to 25% of the weird’s point value and with no preparation.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Any nonelemental creature entering a pool without the weird’s permission must win in a Quick Contest of Will with the weird each second or be irrevocably transformed into the elemental material of the pool. Creatures granted access to the pool by the weird are not subject to transformation or damage. However, creatures allowed to enter a pool must still provide their own protection from the elemental material, as well as the means to breathe and move within that enviroment. A weird is physically tied to its pool and cannot leave except to return to its native plane through the portal. A weird may rise up to its height above the surface of its pool, but the lower part of its body must always remain in contact with the elemental material. Once a weird exits the pool for its native plane, the portal closes, and the pool loses its special effects. Opening the portal works identically to the [Create Planar Gate] spell.

The character gets only one chance, no matter how much belladonna is consumed. The belladonna must be reasonably fresh (picked within the last week).However, fresh or not, belladonna is toxic. The character must succeed on an HT-4 roll or take 2d toxic damage.The only other way to remove the affliction is to cast Remove Curse on the character during one of the three days of the full moon. After receiving the spell, the character must succeed on a Will-4 roll to break the curse (the caster knows if the spell works). If the save fails, the process must be repeated.Characters undergoing this cure are often kept bound or confined in cages until the cure takes effect.Only afflicted lycanthropes can be cured of lycanthropy.SAMPLE LYCANTHROPESWereserpent [Serpent Kingdoms, page 69]Typical Stats – Human FormST:13HP:13Speed:6DX:12Will:10Move:6IQ:10Per:10HT:11FP:11SM+0Dodge:10Parry:11UDR:3* on torso (1 vs crushing)Glaive (14): swing 2d+2 cutting, Reach 2-3*; or thrust 2d-1 impaling (KYOS: 2d), Reach 1-3*.Alternate Form: A natural or an afflicted lycanthrope who is aware of his condition may assume a hybrid or an animal form as per Alternate Form (p.

In a stressful situation, such as any situation that requires a Fright Check or a self-control roll for a mental disadvantage, or combat – the lycanthrope must make a Will roll to avoid shifting into his animal form. He needs to roll once per situation, and a roll of 14+ is always a failure.When a natural lycanthrope in his hybrid or animal form damages a creature with his bite, the creature must roll 3d vs. the HP of injury it received (maximum one roll per day). If it rolls under the damage amount, he becomes afflicted with lycanthropy. It gains the appropriate lycanthrope lens, but is unaware of its condition. The first transformation into the animal form happens at night during full moon or when the afflicted creature takes injury. When an afflicted lycanthrope shifts into his animal form this way, he becomes an NPC under the GM’s control until the next dawn, losing his identity and receiving the Wild Animal meta-trait (p.

A barghest is a lupine fiend that can take the shape of a wolf or a goblin. In its natural form, it resembles a goblin–wolf hybrid with terrible jaws and sharp claws. Barghests come into the world to feed on blood and souls and thus grow stronger.Barghest [Monster Manual, page 22]Typical Stats - BarghestSharp Claws (13):&nbsp;thrust 1d cutting (KYOS: 1d+2 cutting), Reach C.Vampiric Bite (13):&nbsp;thrust 1d cutting (KYOS: 1d+2 cutting), Reach C. The barghest can drain the victim’s life if the victim is helpless (pinned, stunned, unconscious, etc.), grappled, or willing. If he is wearing armor, the barghest’s biting damage must penetrate its DR. Once the barghest has bitten through the victim’s DR, he can drain 1 HP per second from him. For every 3 HP stolen, the barghest heals 1 HP or 1 FP (his choice). He cannot raise his HP or FP above normal this way.Change Shape:&nbsp;The barghest can shapeshift into a goblin or a wolf (p. B458). The process takes 10 seconds.Spell-Like Abilities&nbsp;(Alternative Abilities):<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2017/02/sorcery-mind-control-spells.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2017/02/sorcery-mind-control-spells.html" target="_self">Berserker</a>&nbsp;(10);<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2017/05/sorcery-movement-spells-iii.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2017/05/sorcery-movement-spells-iii.html" target="_self">Levitation 2</a>&nbsp;(10);<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2017/05/sorcery-mind-control-spells-iii.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2017/05/sorcery-mind-control-spells-iii.html" target="_self">Suggestion</a>&nbsp;(10).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traits:&nbsp;Bad Grip 1; Discriminatory Smell; Extended Lifespan 1; Fur; Horizontal; Infravision.Skills**:**&nbsp;Brawling-13; Stealth-13; Tracking-13.Notes: Size 2 hexes.Creature Type**:**&nbsp;Outsider (Evil, Lawful).Typical Stats – Greater BarghestSharp Claws (14):&nbsp;thrust 1d+2 cutting (KYOS: 2d+2 cutting), Reach C-1.Vampiric Bite (14):&nbsp;thrust 1d+2 cutting (KYOS: 2d+2 cutting), Reach C.

The chuul is one of the monsters that I've always liked, but never got a chance to use. It's crabby, snappy, tentacly.Pincers (12):&nbsp;thrust 2d+2 cutting (KYOS: 4d-1 cutting), Reach C-1. The chuul can either nip and let go or hold on and grapple the victim in addition to injuring him. Either is an attack that takes full hit location penalties – not halved for grappling. Treat this attack as a bite for these purposes (see Teeth on page 115 of GURPS Martial Arts for details). The pincers give +2 with tasks that require a firm grip (including climbing).Weak Bite (12):&nbsp;thrust 1d+2 crushing, Reach C.Paralytic Tentacles (11): A chuul can lash out with its tentacles to paralyze his victim. This attack has Reach C and cannot parry. If the tentacle touches bare skin, the victim must roll HT to resist. He becomes paralyzed for 3 seconds per point of margin of failure.&nbsp;After that the subject is stunned (p.

Vrocks are mid-tier winged demons with an array of interesting special abilities. Vrock [Monster Manual, page 48]Sharp Claws (14):&nbsp;thrust 2d cutting (KYOS: 3d+1 cutting). Reach C-1.Sharp Beak (14):&nbsp;thrust 2d large piercing (KYOS: 3d+1 large piercing). Reach C.Stunning Screech (14):&nbsp;Once per hour the vrock can emit a screech that stuns every non-demon everyone in a cone-shaped area. Cones use special rules; see&nbsp;Area and Spreading Attacks&nbsp;(p. B413). The cone has a maximum width of 5 yards at the maximum range of 10 yards. This ability has no 1/2D range. Everyone within must resist with HT; Protected Hearing gives +5, Hard of Hearing gives +4, and those with Deafness are immune.Spores:&nbsp;Once every 15 seconds the vrock can emit a 2-yard radius cloud of spores around himself. This requires a Concentrate maneuver and costs 1 FP. The spores work as a contact agent, ignoring unsealed DR and dealing 1 point of toxic damage every 10 seconds for 6 cycles total. At the end of this time, the victim is covered with a tangle of viny growths. The vines are harmless and wither away in 1d4 days. The spores can be removed with a successful Physician roll (takes 10 seconds). Bless, neutralize poison, or remove disease kills the spores, as does sprinkling the victim with a vial of holy water.Dance of Ruin:&nbsp;To use this ability, a group of at least three vrocks must join hands in a circle, dancing wildly and chanting. At the end of 16 seconds of dancing, a wave of crackling energy flashes outward in a 32-yard radius. All creatures except for demons within the radius take 6d crushing damage. This affects even insubstantial creatures. Stunning, paralyzing, or slaying one of the vrocks stops the dance. The dance costs each vrock 2 FP.Spell-Like Abilities&nbsp;(Alternative Abilities):<br>Anarchic Weapon (14):&nbsp;See this&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2016/10/imbuements-and-sorcery-align-weapon.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2016/10/imbuements-and-sorcery-align-weapon.html" target="_self">post</a>.<br>Apportation 14:&nbsp;See this&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2017/05/sorcery-movement-spells-ii.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2017/05/sorcery-movement-spells-ii.html" target="_self">post</a>.<br>Mirror Image 1:&nbsp;See this&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2018/03/sorcery-illusion-and-creation-spells-ii.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2018/03/sorcery-illusion-and-creation-spells-ii.html" target="_self">post</a>.<br>Teleport (10):&nbsp;See this&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2016/11/sorcery-movement-and-communication.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2016/11/sorcery-movement-and-communication.html" target="_self">post</a>.<br>Unholy Weapon (14):&nbsp;See this&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2016/10/imbuements-and-sorcery-align-weapon.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2016/10/imbuements-and-sorcery-align-weapon.html" target="_self">post</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traits:&nbsp;Combat Reflexes;

Notes: Dire vultures can parry with their iron-hard beaks. They will flee after losing half their HP.

They will attack the least heavily armored targets and may, on a successful Per roll, notice recent wounds as well. Instead of striking for damage, they may, on a failed Kleptomania roll, grab at a prominent interesting object (a helmet, a jeweled staff, etc.) and try to fly off with it.<img alt="Pasted image 20220127132811.png" src="99_reference/rule-mechanics/z_asset-files/pasted-image-20220127132811.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>40_bestiary/42_monsters/dire-vulture.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">40_Bestiary/42_Monsters/Dire Vulture.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gibbering Mouther]]></title><description><![CDATA[Infobox

The gibbering mouther is an amorphous mass of mouths and eyes. It can use only six mouths at the same time, and can create protoplasmic manipulators to push objects (hence No Fine Manipulators, not No Manipulators). It can spit acid, soften earth, confuse creatures with its gibbering, and attack six times per second. It has so many eyes that it effectively has Injury Tolerance (No Eyes).Gibbering Mouther [Monster Manual, page 126]Vampiric Bite (12):&nbsp;1d+1 cutting (KYOS: 2d cutting), Reach C. The gibbering mouther can drain the victim’s life if the victim is helpless (pinned, stunned, unconscious, etc.), grappled, or willing. If he is wearing armor, the gibbering mouther’s biting damage must penetrate its DR. Once the gibbering mouther has bitten through the victim’s DR, it can drain 1 HP per second from him. For every 3 HP stolen, the gibbering mouther heals 1 HP or 1 FP (its choice). It cannot raise its HP or FP above normal this way.Spit Acid (12):&nbsp;1d-1 corrosion. Ranged attack (Acc 3, Range 10/10), costs 1 FP.Gibbering:&nbsp;As soon as a mouther spots something edible, it begins a constant gibbering. When a creature hears this gibbering, it must roll a Fright Check using the Confusion table (GURPS Powers, p. 85). If a victim succeeds at his Fright Check, he will be unaffected by this ability for one hour.Ground Manipulation:&nbsp;A gibbering mouther can cause stone and earth in a 4-yard radius around it to become a morass akin to quicksand. This requires a Concentrate maneuver and costs 1 FP. Mired creatures are grappled with ST 12. Their only way to free themselves is to break free with a successful Quick Contest of ST. Softening stone requires two consecutive Concentrate maneuvers. This effect persists for 10 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traits:&nbsp;360° Vision; Constriciton Attack; Disturbing Voice; Extra Attack 5; Extra Mouth 5; Horizontal; Immunity to Ground Manipulation; Infravision; Injury Tolerance (Damage Reduction 2; Limited, Crushing); Injury Tolerance (Homogenous, No Blood, No Eyes, No Head, No Neck); Invertebrate; No Fine Manipulators; No Legs (Slithers).Skills**:**&nbsp;Brawling-12; Innate Attack (Breath)-12.Creature Type**:**&nbsp;Aberration.Notes**:**&nbsp;Size 2 hexes; Weight 200 lbs.356 pointsAttribute Modifiers:&nbsp;ST+5 (No Fine Manipulators, -40%) [30]; IQ-4 [-80]; HT+3 [30].Secondary Characteristic Modifiers:&nbsp;Will+4 [20]; Per+4 [20]; Basic Move -2 [-10].Advantages:&nbsp;360° Vision [25]; Amphibious [10]; Constriction Attack [15]; DR 2 (Can’t Wear Armor, -40%; Tough Skin, -40%) [2]; Extra Attack 5 [125]; Extra Mouth 5 [25]; Infravision [10]; Injury Tolerance (Damage Reduction 2; Limited, Crushing, -40%) [30]; Injury Tolerance (Homogenous, No Blood, No Eyes, No Head, No Neck) [62]; Vampiric Bite [30].Gibbering: Terror 1 (Confusion; Hearing; Magical, -10%) [27].Ground Manipulation: Binding 12 (Area Effect, 4 yards, +100%; Costs 1 FP, -5%; Emanation, -20%; Environmental, Earth or Stone, -40%; Magical, -10%; Persistent, +40%; Takes Extra Time 1 for Stone, -5%; Unbreakable, +40%) [48].Spittle: Corrosion Attack 1d-1 (Blockable, -5%; Costs 1 FP, -5%; Increased 1/2D, x10, +15%; One-Shot, -10%; Reduced Range, 1/10, -30%) [6].Disadvantages:&nbsp;Disturbing Voice [-10]; Horizontal [-10]; Invertebrate [-20]; No Fine Manipulators [-30].Perks:&nbsp;Immunity to Ground Manipulation [1].Features:&nbsp;No Legs (Slithers) [0].Creature Type: AberrationNotes:&nbsp;Size 2 hexes; Weight 200 lbs.Knowing Your Own Strength [376]Replace ST+5 (No Fine Manipulators, -40%) [30] with ST+5 [50]]]></description><link>40_bestiary/42_monsters/gibbering-mouther.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">40_Bestiary/42_Monsters/Gibbering Mouther.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:07:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/MM35_gallery/MM35_PG126.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/MM35_gallery/MM35_PG126.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gnome]]></title><description><![CDATA[The gnomes in D&amp;D are small humanoids with minor magical powers, in Pathfinder they also are migrants from the First World, the world of the fey. While interesting, I've never seen a person play a gnome, and even use gnome as an NPC. I think gnomes are the most overlooked "core" race.ROCK GNOME [-24] (Player’s Handbook, page 16)Attributes: ST-5 [-50]; HT+1 [10].Secondary Characteristics: SM -2; FP +1 [3]; Basic Move -1 [-5].Advantages: Acute Hearing 1 [2]; Acute Taste and Smell 1 [2]; Extended Lifespan 2 [4]; Night Vision 5 [5].Light: Illumination (2-yard radius, 1 minute; Limited Use, 1/day, -40%; Magical, -10%) [1].Sound: Illusion (Auditory only, -70%; Limited Use, 1/day, -40%; Magical, -10%) [5].Burrowing Animal Speech: Speak with Animals (Burrowing animals only, -60%; Magical, -10%) [8].Perks: Intuitive Illusionist [1].Rock gnomes are the "standard" gnomes.

In fact, there’s nothing human about them at all – they aren’t sapient, don’t use tools, and don’t speak. Though they have no hands, their feet sport large claws. They’re usually encountered in groups of five or more, active day or night. They are most commonly found in the badlands of al-Haz and al-Wazif or in mountainous areas of the Great Forest and the Emperor’s Forest.Harpies take a bizarre, compulsive delight in befouling food and drink; the stench they leave sends most other beings reeling, and the food will be completely inedible. Otherwise, they act much like aggressive predatory animals, with neither a fear of humans nor any great interest in human prey. They will rarely harm anyone not in their way, but will viciously attack anyone who is. People wounded by a harpy’s claws must roll for infection (p. B444); treat this as a wound with infected matter in it.Harpies usually attack with their claws from above (often striking for opponents’ heads).

Reach C-1.Adhesive: A mimic exudes a thick slime that acts as a powerful adhesive, holding fast any creatures or items that touch it. Adhesive has ST 12 and can only be damaged by cutting or burning attacks. Strong alcohol dissolves the adhesive, but the mimic still can grapple normally. A mimic can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 30 seconds after the creature dies. See Binding, p. B40 for more details.Mimic Shape: A mimic can assume the general shape of any object that fills roughly 150 cubic feet (5 feet by 5 feet by 6 feet), such as a massive chest, a stout bed, or a wide door frame. The creature cannot substantially alter its size, though. A mimic’s body is hard and has a rough texture, no matter what appearance it might present. Anyone who examines the mimic by touch can detect the ruse by making a successful Touch roll. Of course, by this time it is generally far too late.The mimic can always take on the form of an object he can see or touch. Once it have assumed a form, it can opt to memorize it by concentrating for one minute. This allows the mimic to shapeshift into that form at any time. It can memorize a number of forms equal to its IQ.

Others get a +2 bonus when targeting the mind flayer’s jaw.Typical Sorcery Spells Known/Improvised:<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2017/06/sorcery-knowledge-spells-ii.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2017/06/sorcery-knowledge-spells-ii.html" target="_self"><strong></strong></a>Analyze Magic;<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2016/11/sorcery-acid-spells-and-more.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2016/11/sorcery-acid-spells-and-more.html" target="_self"><strong></strong></a>Daze (17);Detect Magic (17) - see GURPS Thaumatology – Sorcery, page 19;<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2018/01/sorcery-necromantic-spells-ix.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2018/01/sorcery-necromantic-spells-ix.html" target="_self"><strong></strong></a>Disrupt Undead 4 (15);<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2018/02/sorcery-debuff-spells.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2018/02/sorcery-debuff-spells.html" target="_self"><strong></strong></a>Ray of Enfeeblement (15);<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2018/02/sorcery-debuff-spells.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2018/02/sorcery-debuff-spells.html" target="_self"><strong></strong></a>Ray of Exhaustion 2 (15).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's go back to converting monsters, there aren't that&nbsp;many left in the Monster Manual&nbsp;for D&amp;D 3.5. This post details the rakshasa - an innately magical shapeshifting/mindreading tigerman. Also, I decided to also add the description of their racial deity Ravanna from the Dragon Magazine #326. The deity's portfolio is very similar to the scope of rakshasas innate spellcasting, so why would a rakshasa worship their own racial deity? I've decided to change things a bit to make the deity expand their racial spellcasting.Rakshasa [Monster Manual, page 211]Sharp Claws (15): 1d-1 cutting (KYOS: 1d cutting).

They have four small, pincer-like legs that they use to clamp onto the necks of their victims. They are rusty-red to reddish brown in color, and their eyes and feet are yellowish. The dangling proboscises of stirges are pink at the tip, fading to gray at the base (near their heads). Stirges must be killed to be removed, due to their strong grip. If an attack against an attached stirge misses, make another attack roll against the victim’s Armor Class to see if the attack hits the victim instead. Caution is advisable when attempting to remove an attached stirge.Stirges can breed in captivity, but a constant supply of blood is needed. Stirges mostly kill low-level humans, animals and children, so the arrival of these predators in any civilized territory is always a cause for alarm. Fortunately, even a low-level group of adventurers or town militia is usually capable of ending the menace with little or no loss of life.Ecology: Stirges have an acute sense of smell, can see in the dark, and can sense heat sources within 200 feet. These senses keep stirges informed when living creatures enter their habitat. Creatures with a natural AC of 3 or better are usually immune to a stirge’s blood draining attack, since their hides are too thick to penetrate. As a consequence, huge nests of stirges live symbiotically with some evil dragons. Characters who protect their entire bodies with special leather or better armor (this special armor costs two to three times more than normal armor) can safely approach a stirge. Even the slightest gap in the protection is seen and smelled by the creature, and a successful attack roll means the creature has broken through the weakness and locked on. After a stirge has gorged itself by draining blood, it sleeps for one day, plus one day for every 2 points of blood it drank (the maximum sleep period is after drinking 12 points of blood – seven days). During this period of rest, silent attackers can impose a -2 penalty to the stirges’ surprise roll, as the beasts wake slowly and remain drowsy for a few moments. They are most vulnerable at this time. While certain species of stirges prefer to dine on human blood, most are content with any large mammal, like cows, moose, and deer. Experienced druids and rangers usually recognize the traces of a stirge colony by the occurrences of mysteriously drained and dead animals in the vicinity. A stirge colony’s territory extends for only a mile in diameter, so stirges move around a lot after they’ve drained a region of the available blood. Often, the presence of stirges is only discovered long after the colony has departed, making it very difficult to track them.ST 5; DX 15; IQ 4; HT 11.Will 10; Per 10; Speed 6.5; Dodge 9; Move 2 (ground); 12 (air). SM-5; HP 7 (): Grappling (17); Innate Attack [piercing] (17); Damage: 1d-2; If the proboscis penetrates the victim’s DR, the stirge drains 1 HP per second from him. For every 3 HP stolen, the stirge heals either 1 HP or 1 FP. The stirge cannot raise HP or FP above normal this way. A stirge is vulnerable when feeding in this manner and will be unable to dodge any attack directed at it. A missed attack, however, may hit the stirge’s victim!

However, any character not already able to use spells gains has -1 to ST, DX, IQ, and HT for as long as the book is in her possession or while she uses its power. A book of infinite spells contains 2d+22 pages. The nature of each page is determined by a 1d roll: 1-3, arcane spell; 4-6, divine spell.Determine the exact spell randomly.Once a page is turned, it can never be flipped back—paging through a book of infinite spells is a one-way trip. If the book is closed, it always opens again to the page it was on before the book was closed. When the last page is turned, the book vanishes.Once per day the owner of the book can cast the spell to which the book is opened. If that spell happens to be one that the character can cast via her own spellcasting abilities, she can cast it up to four times per day. The pages cannot be ripped out without destroying the book. Similarly, the spells cannot be cast as scroll spells, nor can they be copied into a spellbook—their magic is bound up permanently within the book itself.The owner of the book need not have the book on her person in order to use its power. The book can be stored in a place of safety while the owner is adventuring and still allow its owner to cast spells by means of its power.Each time a spell is cast, there is a chance that the energy connected with its use causes the page to magically turn despite all precautions. The owner knows this and may even benefit from the turning by gaining access to a new spell. The chance of a page turning depends on the spell the page contains and what sort of spellcaster the owner is. | Condition | Chance of Page Turning (on 2d roll) |
