Also, the question isn't whether a creature can see you when you are hiding. The question is whether it can see you clearly.When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.There’s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. The Stealth check is contested by the creature's Passive Perception score. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5.You can’t hide from a creature that can see you, and if you make noise (such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase), you give away your position.An invisible creature can’t be seen, so it can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, however, and it still has to stay quiet.In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the Dungeon Master might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack before you are seen.One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be lightly or heavily obscured.In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.A heavily obscured area—such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely.

This is separate from modifiers for the culture, equipment, language, tech level, etc. of the person attempting the task, in that it applies to anyone who attempts the task. It is cumulative with all other modifiers. For instance, if the GM rules that the only way to sway a particular audience is to make a Public Speaking roll at -2, the difficulty modifier is -2. Any speaker has -2, in addition to personal modifiers (for culture, language, Voice, etc.), when dealing with that audience. Many skills suggest difficulty modifiers – e.g., the -5 to use Lockpicking skill by touch – but the possible variety of tasks is essentially infinite. Here are some guidelines for GMs:\n+10 – Automatic. Tasks so trivial that the GM should waive the need for a success roll, except under extraordinary circumstances. Example: A Driving roll to start a car.\n+8 or +9 – Trivial. Situations where failure is extremely unlikely, and would require incredibly bad luck. Example: A Driving roll to drive around an empty parking lot.\n+6 or +7 – Very Easy. Tasks where failure is possible, but would require bad luck. Example: A Driving roll to drive down an empty suburban street.\n+4 or +5 – Easy. Most mundane tasks, including rolls made by ordinary people at day-to-day jobs. Example: A Driving roll to commute to work in a small town.\n+2 or +3 – Very Favorable. Mildly risky tasks that most people would undertake without hesitation. Example: A Driving roll to commute to work in a teeming metropolis.\n+1 – Favorable. Tasks that most people would hesitate at, due to the risk, but that a career adventurer would regard as easy. Example: A Driving roll to compete in a road rally. 0 – Average. Most adventuring tasks, and the majority of skill use under stress. Example: A Driving roll in a car chase.\n-1 – Unfavorable. Stressful tasks that would challenge a novice adventurer, but not an old hand. Example: A Driving roll in a high-speed car chase.\n-2 or -3 – Very Unfavorable. Stressful tasks that would challenge a professional. Skilled adventurers still routinely accept such risks! Example: A Driving roll in a highspeed car chase on a busy freeway.\n-4 or -5 – Hard. Tasks so challenging that even an expert will look for alternatives. A true “master” is still unlikely to feel challenged. Example: A Driving roll to keep the car on the road while shooting a gun out the window during a highspeed chase.\n-6 or -7 – Very Hard. Situations that even the masters might have second thoughts about. Example: A Driving roll in a high-speed chase during a blizzard.\n-8 or -9 – Dangerous. Tasks at which even the greatest masters expect to fail. Example: A Driving roll while shooting a gun in a high-speed chase during a blizzard.\n-10 – Impossible. No sane person would attempt such a task. The GM may wish to forbid such attempts altogether. Example: A Driving roll to steer a car with the knees while firing a bazooka twohanded during a chase through a blizzard.\nThese modifiers assume a trained character. To get an idea of how tough a task would be for someone working at default, add the default penalty to the difficulty modifier. Example: Someone who never learned to drive is using Driving at its DX-5 default. For him, an everyday commute – “Easy” (+4 or +5) for a trained driver – would be “Average” (DX) or even “Unfavorable” (DX-1), and almost certainly a stressful experience! The GM can use difficulty modifiers in place of other modifiers if the outcome of a task is too unimportant – or the action too hot – to justify stopping to add up a long string of modifiers. For instance, in a car chase involving a car in bad repair, the GM might bump the difficulty up a level or two instead of assessing an equipment modifier for the car.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"00_gm-screen/checks/task-difficulty.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1768662377572,"modifiedTime":1765595229000,"sourceSize":4140,"sourcePath":"00_GM Screen/Checks/Task Difficulty.md","exportPath":"00_gm-screen/checks/task-difficulty.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":6,"backlinks":["00_gm-screen/0.-gm-screen.html"],"type":"markdown"},"00_gm-screen/checks/vision,-light-&-torches.html":{"title":"Vision, Light & Torches","icon":"","description":"In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.A heavily obscured area—such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature in a heavily obscured area effectively suffers from the blinded condition.Darkvision enables a character to see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it was bright light. In darkness, at least some light is necessary for dark vision to function. If the light is dim enough as to be very near darkness, a character's darkvision may be limited in the DM's discretion.EQUIPMENTTorch - A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.Lantern, Bullseye - A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.Lantern, Hooded - A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.Candle - For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Vision, Light &amp; Torches","level":1,"id":"Vision,_Light_&_Torches_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"00_gm-screen/checks/vision,-light-&-torches.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1768662377572,"modifiedTime":1765595229000,"sourceSize":1449,"sourcePath":"00_GM Screen/Checks/Vision, Light & Torches.md","exportPath":"00_gm-screen/checks/vision,-light-&-torches.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":7,"backlinks":["00_gm-screen/0.-gm-screen.html"],"type":"markdown"},"00_gm-screen/🧙-unified-symbol-magic-—-gm-screen-(mos-reference).html":{"title":"🧙 Unified Symbol Magic — GM Screen (MoS Reference)","icon":"","description":"Margin of Success (MoS) is a spendable resource.*\nIt determines how big, how long, and how deadly* a spell is.\nMoS is budget, not bonus damage.\nYou may split MoS across multiple effects.\nCombat spells usually cap at scene-long unless S-Rank.

You cannot Feint someone unless you could have hit him with a melee attack – that is, your weapon is ready and your foe is within reach. This maneuver is not an attack, though, and does not make your weapon unready.When you Feint, roll a Quick Contest of Melee Weapon skills with your foe; if either of you is unarmed, you may roll against an unarmed combat skill instead. Your opponent may opt to roll against Cloak or Shield skill, if he is suitably equipped and this would give him a better roll. If his DX is better than his combat skills, he may roll against DX instead.If you fail your roll, your Feint is unsuccessful. Likewise, if you succeed, but your foe succeeds by as much as or more than you do, your Feint fails.If you make your roll, and your foe fails, subtract your margin of success from the foe’s active defense if you attack him with Attack, All-Out Attack, or Move and Attack on your next turn. For instance, if your skill is 15 and you roll a 12, your foe defends against you at -3 next turn.If you and your foe both succeed, but you succeed by more, subtract your margin of victory from the foe’s defense. For instance, if your skill is 15 and you roll a 10 (success by 5), and your foe’s skill is 14 and he rolls 12 (success by 2), you win by 3, so he will defend at -3 if your next maneuver is to attack him.You cannot Feint if your foe is unable to observe you! However, if your foe runs away, turns his back on you, or loses sight of you in some way after you successfully Feint, he will still suffer his defense penalty if you attack him on your next turn. If you lose track of the foe, or cannot attack him next turn, your foe’s defense penalty vanishes.A Feint is good for one second! But if you Feint and then make an All-Out Attack (Double), the feint applies to both attacks.In all cases, your allies cannot take advantage of your Feint. The defense penalty applies only to your next attack.Shield Feints: After you have attacked your foe once by striking with your shield (see p. 406), you may also Feint with your shield, rolling against Shield skill.Movement: Step.Active Defense: Any.

If that happens, you may transform your Wait into an Attack, Feint, All-Out Attack (you must specify the option before acting), or Ready maneuver. If you are reacting to someone else, this interrupts his turn, but he can resume it after you’ve acted.You must specify exactly what your action will be when you take the Wait maneuver, and what will trigger it. For instance, “I’ll make an All-Out Attack (Determined) with my sword on the first orc to move toward me.”You may take a Wait with a ready ranged weapon; this is known as “covering” a target or area. If so, you must specify the zone that you are covering with that weapon. There is no penalty to cover a one-yard area. For larger areas and additional rules, see Opportunity Fire (p. 390).You can use the Wait maneuver for any “reflex action” you want to plan in advance, provided you specify both the response and the action that will trigger it. This can include holding a knife at a hostage’s throat, or even a noncombat action (e.g., “If Dora sees any orcs, she will pull this rope immediately – otherwise, she does nothing.”). An action only qualifies as a “reflex” if you could do it in a single motion. The GM’s decision is final.Finally, you can use Wait to coordinate actions with slower friends.Stop Thrust: If you have a ready thrusting weapon, you can use a Wait to brace your weapon to receive a possible enemy charge. Simply state, “I brace for a stop thrust.” You can convert your Wait into an Attack or All-Out Attack against any one foe that moves one or more yards toward you to make a melee attack (armed or unarmed, including a slam or a grapple) or evade (see Evading, p. 368). You strike first if you have the longer reach. If you hit and your foe fails to defend, add +1 to thrust damage for every two full yards your attacker moved toward you. Movement: None until your Wait is triggered.

This is called “knockback.” Only crushing and cutting attacks can cause knockback. A crushing attack can cause knockback regardless of whether it penetrates DR. A cutting attack can cause knockback only if it fails to penetrate DR. Knockback depends on basic damage rolled before subtracting DR. For every full multiple of the target’s ST-2 rolled, move the target one yard away from the attacker. For instance, a man with ST 10 would be knocked back one yard per full 8 points of basic damage. If the target has ST 3 or less, knockback is one yard per point of basic damage! If the target has no ST score at all (like a wall), or is not resisting, use its HP instead. Anyone who suffers knockback must attempt a roll against the highest of DX, Acrobatics, or Judo. If he is knocked back more than one yard, he rolls at -1 per yard after the first. Perfect Balance (p. 74) gives +4 to this roll. On a failure, he falls down. If you knock your foe into something solid, the result – including damage to him and whatever he hit – is as if he had collided with it at a speed equal to the yards of knockback.

In this case, the attackers should get one or more “free turns.” The GM is responsible for determining when the attackers have achieved surprise.A character with Combat Reflexes is rarely surprised, and will never “freeze.” He also gets +6 on all IQ rolls to recover from surprise. Note that many wild animals have Combat Reflexes – see Chapter 16 for examples.Total SurpriseWhen the defenders are taken completely by surprise, they “freeze.” The GM rolls 1d. This is the number of seconds that pass before the defenders can react at all. Until that time is up, they are mentally stunned and must take the Do Nothing maneuver. Exception: Those with Combat Reflexes never freeze, and treat total surprise as partial surprise.Adventurers, guards, etc. rarely suffer total surprise unless they are actually asleep. But total surprise would be appropriate if a group of werewolves came charging through the door of the local library. (In fact, such an extreme case might justify a Fright Check – at least for the librarian.)After the initial “freeze” ends, each defender must roll against his basic IQ at the start of his turn until he recovers. On a success, he must take Do Nothing that turn, but can act normally for the rest of the combat. On a failure, he is still mentally stunned; he may roll again at the start of his next turn. A low-IQ character, taken totally by surprise, could miss the whole combat!Partial SurpriseThis may occur when the defenders were expecting trouble . . . or when each party surprised the other! The GM should require each side to roll for initiative.To determine who gets the initiative, the leader of each side rolls 1d. A leader with Combat Reflexes gets +2, or +1 if he doesn’t have Combat Reflexes but someone else on his side does (this bonus is not cumulative for more than one character). The leader with the higher IQ gets +1. Having even one point in Tactics skill gives +1 on initiative rolls; Tactics at level 20+ gives +2. The GM can apply other modifiers as he sees fit; e.g., if he thinks one side was more alert than the other.If one side is totally leaderless, the GM rolls for them. They get an automatic -2 to initiative. (This does not apply to animals or any other group with IQ 5 or less.)The side that gets the highest roll gets the initiative, and can move and act normally. Everyone on the other side is mentally stunned, and must make IQ rolls on their turns, as described for total surprise, to snap out of it. However, with partial surprise, there is a +1 bonus to IQ on the second turn, +2 on the third turn, and so on . . . even low IQ characters catch on after a few seconds.

Specify how this works when you buy the advantage: entangling your victim in vines, tying him up with webs, freezing him inside a block of ice, turning the ground to quicksand beneath his feet, etc. Binding is a ranged attack with 1/2D –, Max 100, Acc 3, RoF 1, Shots N/A, and Recoil 1. You can add modifiers to change these statistics (see pp. 101-116).On a hit, your victim is grappled (see p. 370) and rooted in place. He cannot select the Move or Change Posture maneuvers or change facing, and is at -4 to DX. The ST of this effect is equal to your Binding level, but you can layer additional attacks on a successfully bound victim. Each extra layer gives +1 to ST.To break free, the victim must win a Quick Contest of ST or Escape skill against the ST of your Binding. Each attempt takes one second. If the victim fails to break free, he loses 1 FP but may try again. Alternatively, he may try to destroy the Binding. Innate Attacks hit automatically; other attacks are at -4. External attacks on the Binding take no penalty, but risk hitting the victim on a miss (see Striking Into a Close Combat, p. 392). The Binding has DR equal to 1/3 your level (rounded down). Each point of damage reduces ST by one. At ST 0, the Binding is destroyed and the victim is freed.To simulate vines, webs, and so forth, add one or more of Area Effect (p. 102), Persistent (p. 107), and Wall (p. 109) – and possibly some of the special modifiers below.Special EnhancementsEngulfing: Your attack pins the target. He cannot move his limbs or speak; his only options are to use purely mental abilities, to attack the Binding with an Innate Attack, or to try to break free using ST (not Escape skill). If he tries to break free and fails, he is only allowed a repeated attempt every 10 seconds – and on a 17 or 18, he becomes so entangled that he cannot escape on his own! +60%.Only Damaged By X: Only specific damage types can damage your Binding. +30% for one of burning, corrosion, crushing, or cutting; +20% for any two; +10% for any three.Sticky: Your Binding is treated as Persistent (p. 107), but only affects those who actually touch the original target of your attack. +20%. Unbreakable: Your Binding cannot be destroyed. The only way to escape is to break free. +40%.Special LimitationsEnvironmental: Your Binding manipulates an existing condition or object in the environment, and won’t work in its absence.

Subtract this from the damage done by any physical or energy attack after the DR of artificial armor (you can normally wear armor over natural DR) but before multiplying the injury for damage type. By default, natural DR does not protect your eyes (or windows, if you are a vehicle) or help against purely mental attacks, such as telepathy.Normal humans cannot purchase DR at all. Creatures with natural armor can buy DR 1 to 5. Thick skin or a pelt would be DR 1; pig hide, armadillo shell, a heavy pelt, or scales like those of a lizard would be DR 2; rhinoceros hide or a pangolin’s armor plates would be DR 3; alligator scales or elephant hide would be DR 4; and a giant tortoise would have DR 5. Robots, supers, supernatural entities, etc. can purchase any amount of DR, subject to GM approval.Many special modifiers are available to change the basic assumptions of this advantage.Special EnhancementsAbsorption: You can absorb damage and use it to enhance your abilities. Each point of DR stops one point of damage and turns it into one character point that you can use to improve traits (anything but skills) temporarily. You store these points in a “battery” with capacity equal to DR (e.g., DR 10 gives a 10-point battery). Once this battery is full, each point of DR will still stop one point of damage, but will not convert it into a character point. You do not have to use stored points immediately, but you cannot reallocate points once used. You lose absorbed points – unused ones first – at the rate of one point per second. You lose enhanced abilities as the points drain away. (Exception: If you are missing HP or FP, you can heal yourself. Restoring one HP drains 2 stored points immediately; restoring one FP drains 3 points. Such healing is permanent. Only HP or FP in excess of your usual scores drain away.) You cannot absorb damage from your own ST or attack abilities. +80% if absorbed points can only enhance one trait (determined when you create your character) or can only heal; +100% if you can raise any trait.Force Field: Your DR takes the form of a field projected a short distance from your body. This protects your entire body – including your eyes – as well as anything you are carrying, and reduces the damage from attacks before armor DR. Effects that rely on touch (such as many magic spells) only affect you if carried by an attack that does enough damage to pierce your DR. +20%.Hardened: Each level of Hardened reduces the armor divisor of an attack by one step. These steps are, in order: “ignores DR,” 100, 10, 5, 3, 2, and 1 (no divisor). +20% per level.Reflection: Your DR “bounces back” any damage it stops at your attacker. The remaining damage affects you normally. The attacker doesn’t get an active defense against the first attack you reflect back at him, but gets his usual defenses against subsequent reflected attacks. Reflection only works vs. direct hits! It cannot reflect damage from explosions, fragments, poison gas, or anything else that affects an entire area. This enhancement is mutually exclusive with Absorption. +100%.Special LimitationsAblative: Your DR stops damage once. Each point of DR stops one point of basic damage but is destroyed in the process. Lost DR “heals” at the same rate as lost HP (including the effects of Regeneration, p. 80). Use this to represent supers who can absorb massive punishment but who lack the mass to justify a large HP score. -80%.Can’t Wear Armor: Your body is designed in such a way that you cannot or will not wear body armor or clothing. -40%.Directional: Your DR only protects against attacks from one direction. -20% for the front (F); -40% for the back (B), right (R), left (L), top (T), or underside (U). Humanoids may only take this limitation for front and back.Flexible: Your DR is not rigid. This leaves you vulnerable to blunt trauma (see p. 379). -20%.Limited: Your DR applies only to certain attack forms or damage types. See Limited Defenses (box) for details. Partial: Your DR only protects a specific hit location. This is worth -10% per -1 penalty to hit that body part (see p. 398). For instance, an animal with butting horns and a thick skull might have “Skull only,” for -70%. “Torso only” is -10%, and also protects the vital organs. When you take this limitation for arms, legs, hands, or feet, the DR protects all limbs of that type. If it only protects one limb, the limitation value doubles (e.g., arms are -2 to hit, so a single arm would be -40%). If you have arms, legs, etc. with different penalties, use the least severe penalty to calculate limitation value.Semi-Ablative: When an attack strikes semi-ablative DR, every 10 points of basic damage rolled removes one point of DR, regardless of whether the attack penetrates DR. Lost DR “heals” as for Ablative (and you cannot combine the two). -20%.\nTough Skin: By default, Damage Resistance is “hard”: armor plate, chitin, etc. With this limitation, your DR is merely tough skin. Any effect that requires a scratch (e.g., poison) or skin contact (e.g., electrical shock or Pressure Points skill) affects you if the attack carrying it penetrates the DR of any armor you are wearing – even if it does exactly 0 damage! Your natural DR, being living tissue, provides no protection at all against such attacks. This limitation includes all the effects of the Flexible limitation (see above); you cannot take both. It is mutually incompatible with Force Field. -40%. “Layered” Defenses\nYou may have multiple “layers” of DR with different combinations of modifiers. You must specify the order of the layers – from outermost to innermost – when you create your character. You may not change this order once set.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/advantages/damage-resistance.html","pathToRoot":"../../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1768662379179,"modifiedTime":1765595229000,"sourceSize":5916,"sourcePath":"10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Advantages/Damage Resistance.md","exportPath":"10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/advantages/damage-resistance.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":51,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/advantages/elemental-meta-traits.html":{"title":"Elemental Meta-Traits","icon":"","description":"VariableYour body is wholly composed of a particular substance.

The GM makes a Sense roll (p. 358) when you first see a magic item, and again when you first touch it. On a success, you intuitively know that the item is magical. A roll of 3 or 4 also tells you whether the magic is helpful or dangerous, and about how strong it is. Those without Magery do not get this roll! 5 points.Magery 1+: Higher levels of Magery make it much easier to learn and use magic. Add your Magery to IQ when you learn spells. For instance, if you have IQ 14, Magery 3 lets you learn spells as if you had IQ 17.

You still have the ability to sense magic, but until you gain experience with magic, the GM should not say, “That idol is magical,” but, “That idol looks very strange to you, very sinister. You sense there is something special about it.” If you are from a nonmagical culture, you do not start with any spells, but you can still learn magic if you find an opportunity. When you enter a magical world, those who can detect your aura recognize you as a potential magic-user. How they react depends on the setting. Magery 0 costs 5 points for all mages, but you may apply one of the limitations below to the 10 points/level for Magery 1+. Limited Magery is sometimes known as “aspected Magery.”Dance: You must be free to use bodily motions in order to cast spells. You are not freed from rituals requiring movement as your spell level increases (see Magic Rituals, p. 237). However, you need not speak at all to cast your spells. -40%. Dark-Aspected: You can only use your powers in darkness. Regardless of the time of day or night, any light greater than candlelight or starlight deprives you of your abilities, though your aura reveals that you are a mage. -50%. Day-Aspected: You can use your powers only when the sun is in the sky – on average, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. During solar eclipses, you have no powers! The effects of other astronomical events are up to the GM. When the sun is down, you have none of your magical abilities, although a look at your aura reveals that you are a mage.

You cannot detect magic items unless they contain at least one spell of your college, in which case you roll normally for detection on first sight and first touch. -40%. Solitary: Your magical abilities are at -3 for every sapient being within five yards of you, and -6 for anyone touching you. As partial compensation, you get a roll vs. IQ to notice any time a sapient creature enters or leaves the five-yard area around you – but this only works on a single person. If there is already someone standing next to you, you won’t notice if someone else approaches. -40%. Song: You must be able to sing in order to cast your spells.

In addition to the traits in this chapter, this includes anything with a negative point cost in Chapter 1: low Status, below-average Wealth, etc. You are probably wondering, \"Why would I want to give my character disadvantages?\" There are two good reasons: Each disadvantage has a negative cost in character points. Thus, disadvantages give you extra character points, which let you improve your character in other ways. But note that disadvantages limit you in proportion to their cost. Be sure to read the disadvantage description in full to know what you are getting into! An imperfection or two makes your character more interesting and realistic, and adds to the fun of roleplaying! Disadvantages for HeroesTwo kinds of disadvantages are particularly suitable for heroic PCs. Roleplayed well, they might limit the character's choices, I but they should make the player's experience more fun.\"Good\" Disadvantages<br>It might seem strange that virtues such as Truthfulness and Sense of Duty are listed as \"disadvantages.\" In the real world, we regard such traits as <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Advantages\" data-href=\"Advantages\" href=\"10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/advantages/advantages.html\" class=\"internal-link data-link-icon data-link-icon-after data-link-text\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-link-tags=\"\" data-link-path=\"10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Advantages/Advantages.md\" style=\"--data-link-path: 10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Advantages/Advantages.md;\">advantages</a> ! Their disadvantage value in GURPS comes from the fact that these virtues limit your freedom of action. For instance, someone with Truthfulness will have trouble lying, even for a good cause; therefore, within the framework of the game, he has a disadvantage. This has one very worthwhile benefit: if you want to create a wholly heroic character, you don't have to take any \"character flaws\" at all. You can get points by choosing only those disadvantages that are actually virtuous!Tragic FlawsMany of the greatest heroes of history and literature had a \"tragic flaw.\" Alcoholism, great ugliness, bad temper, compulsive behavior, and even drug addiction - all are found in the heroes of fact and fiction. So don't assume that your heroes have to be perfect . . . try giving them significant problems to overcome.​Your GM might wish to \"cap\" the extra points you can gain from disadvantages; see Disadvantage Limit (p. 11). This limit applies to the total points you can get from all traits with negative point costs, from Chapter 1 (reduced attributes, low Status, etc.) or the list below. Mandatory disadvantages assigned by the GM don't count against this limit. Most GMs will want to enforce two additional restrictions:<br>Negated Disadvantages: You cannot take a disadvantage that one of your <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Advantages\" data-href=\"Advantages\" href=\"10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/advantages/advantages.html\" class=\"internal-link data-link-icon data-link-icon-after data-link-text\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-link-tags=\"\" data-link-path=\"10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Advantages/Advantages.md\" style=\"--data-link-path: 10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Advantages/Advantages.md;\">advantages</a> would mitigate or negate! For instance, if you have Acute Hearing, you cannot take Hard of Hearing. Contradictory disadvantages, such as Curious and Incurious, are also mutually exclusive. The GM has the final say as to which traits are compatible.Villain Disadvantages: Some disadvantages - Sadism, for instance - are not at all suitable for a \"hero,\" and the GM is free to forbid them to PCs. But they are often found in the more fiendish villains of&nbsp;adventure fiction, so they are included in the interest of good NPC creation.Secret Disadvantages You may give your character a disadvantage unknown both to him and to you. Choose a point value and tell the GM. The GM will select a disadvantage and give you its value plus an additional -5 points (e.g., Unluckiness, normally worth -10 points, gives -15 points as a secret disadvantage) . . . but he will not give you any hints as to what it is! When your disadvantage finally becomes obvious in the course of play (GM's decision), you must buy off the extra -5 points as soon as possible. The GM must pick a secret disadvantage carefully. It should be something that you could believably not know about. If it is a mental disadvantage, the conditions that trigger it should never have arisen (Berserk, Bloodlust, Combat Paralysis, the less-common Phobias, and Split Personality all work well here). Most physical disadvantages are too obvious - although something like Hemophilia might go unnoticed. You can only list one secret disadvantage on your character sheet, but this might represent more than one trait. The GM is free to select multiple, related disadvantages worth the appropriate number of points.\n<br><a data-href=\"Self-Control for Mental Disadvantages\" href=\"10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/disadvantages/self-control-for-mental-disadvantages.html\" class=\"internal-link data-link-icon data-link-icon-after data-link-text\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-link-tags=\"\" data-link-path=\"10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Disadvantages/Self-Control for Mental Disadvantages.md\" style=\"--data-link-path: 10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Disadvantages/Self-Control for Mental Disadvantages.md;\">Self-Control for Mental Disadvantages</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Types of Disadvantages\" href=\"10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/disadvantages/types-of-disadvantages.html\" class=\"internal-link data-link-icon data-link-icon-after data-link-text\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-link-tags=\"\" data-link-path=\"10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Disadvantages/Types of Disadvantages.md\" style=\"--data-link-path: 10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Disadvantages/Types of Disadvantages.md;\">Types of Disadvantages</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Disadvantages","level":1,"id":"Disadvantages_1"},{"heading":"Overview","level":2,"id":"Overview_0"},{"heading":"Restrictions on Disadvantages","level":2,"id":"Restrictions_on_Disadvantages_0"},{"heading":"Governed Content","level":2,"id":"Governed_Content_0"}],"links":["10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/advantages/advantages.html","10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/advantages/advantages.html","10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/advantages/advantages.html","10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/disadvantages/self-control-for-mental-disadvantages.html","10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/disadvantages/types-of-disadvantages.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/disadvantages/disadvantages.html","pathToRoot":"../../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1768662379287,"modifiedTime":1765595229000,"sourceSize":4680,"sourcePath":"10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Disadvantages/Disadvantages.md","exportPath":"10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/disadvantages/disadvantages.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":71,"backlinks":["10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/basic-set-characters.html"],"type":"markdown"},"10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/disadvantages/self-control-for-mental-disadvantages.html":{"title":"Self-Control for Mental Disadvantages","icon":"","description":"Many mental disadvantages do not affect you constantly - you may attempt to control your urges. An asterisk (*) appears next to the point cost of any disadvantage that offers a chance to resist. For each disadvantage like this, you must choose a selfcontrol number: the number you must roll on 3d to avoid giving in. This modifies point value as follows:You resist quite rarely (roll of 6 or less): 2 x listed cost.You resist fairly often (roll of 9 or less): 1.5 x listed cost.You resist quite often (roll of 12 or less): listed cost.You resist almost all the time (roll of 15 or less): 0.5 x listed cost.Drop all fractions (e.g., -22.5 points becomes -22 points).The \"default\" self-control number is 12: you must roll 12 or less on 3d to avoid giving in to your problem. This lets you use disadvantage costs as written. Choose a self-control number of 15 if you wish to have a tendency toward a disadvantage instead of a full-blown case. A self-control number of 9 will regularly limit your options. A self-control number of 6 can be crippling (especially with genuine psychiatric problems).Note your self-control number in parentheses after the name of the disadvantage on your character sheet. For instance, if you can resist Berserk on a roll of 9 or less, write this as \"Berserk (9).\"In circumstances that are likely to trigger your problem, you may opt to roll 3d against your self-control number to see whether your disadvantage actually affects you. If you roll less than or equal to this number, you resist your disadvantage - this time. Otherwise, you suffer the listed effects. This is called a self-control roll.Like all success rolls, self-control rolls arc subject to modifiers. Exceptionally mild or severe stimuli can give bonuses or penalties. Drugs and afflictions can make you more or less likely to give in. Other disadvantages can make you irritable, reducing your odds of resisting. See the disadvantage descriptions for details.Example: Your self-control number is 15, but you are in a highly stressful situation that gives -5 to your self-control roll. You must roll 10 or less to resist your disadvantage. You never have to try a self-control roll - you can always give in willingly, and it is good roleplaying to do so. However, there will be times when you really need to resist your urges, and that is what the roll is for. Be aware that if you attempt self-control rolls too often, the GM may penalize you for bad roleplaying by awarding you fewer earned points.Optionally, the GM may permit you to use one unspent character point to \"buy\" an automatic success on a selfcontrol roll. Points spent this way are gone for good, but there will be times when staying on the straight and narrow is worth the sacrifice. In this case, the GM should not penalize you for bad roleplaying, because you are penalizing yourself!Note that high Will helps you make Fright Checks and resist supernatural emotion control, but it does not improve self-control rolls - not even for disadvantages with effects identical to these things. Mental disadvantages represent an aspect of your personality that you cannot simply will (or reason) away. This is part of what makes them disadvantages!","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Self-Control for Mental Disadvantages","level":1,"id":"Self-Control_for_Mental_Disadvantages_1"},{"heading":"Overview","level":2,"id":"Overview_0"},{"heading":"Self-Control Rolls","level":2,"id":"Self-Control_Rolls_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/disadvantages/self-control-for-mental-disadvantages.html","pathToRoot":"../../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1768662379293,"modifiedTime":1771132962351,"sourceSize":3476,"sourcePath":"10_System_Rules/11_Core_Gurps/General Abilities Article/Basic Set - Characters/Disadvantages/Self-Control for Mental Disadvantages.md","exportPath":"10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/disadvantages/self-control-for-mental-disadvantages.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":72,"backlinks":["10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/disadvantages/disadvantages.html"],"type":"markdown"},"10_system_rules/11_core_gurps/general-abilities-article/basic-set-characters/disadvantages/types-of-disadvantages.html":{"title":"Types of Disadvantages","icon":"","description":"Mental disadvantages originate from your mind or soul.

You can escape them by moving to a new body! If another mind occupies your body, the new owner gains your physical disadvantages.You can acquire a physical disadvantage during play, most likely due to accident or combat. In this case, you immediately suffer the bad effects of the disadvantage. Unlike starting disadvantages, however, physical handicaps acquired in play do not \"give back\" points with which to buy abilities - they just lower your point value!Example: If you start out blind, you start with an extra 50 points . . . but if an explosion blinds you during the game, you're just blind and that's that. Reduce your point total by 50 points to reflect your new disadvantage. You should not keep the same point total and take 50 points of compensating advantages!Physical disadvantages are marked 1.Social disadvantages are associated with your identity. Should it become important to know whether they go with mind or body, the GM's word is I final. Note that this category includes below-average Status, Wealth, and so I forth from Chapter 1.Social disadvantages are marked 2.The GM is the final judge of which category a disadvantage belongs in.

Nonhumans may acquire such traits from their racial template (see Chapter 7), but they still need the GM's permission to take additional exotic disadvantages.Exotic disadvantages are marked 4.Supernatural disadvantages are the result of divine intervention, magic, psionics, etc. With the GM's permission, anyone might be cursed in this way - but only if supernatural powers exist in the game world.Supernatural disadvantages are marked 5.Mundane disadvantages are everything else.

A successful roll lets you recognize the ruins or relics of such a civilization.Magic Items: Knowledge of legendary, typically named and unique, items of power.

Every skill is separate, though some skills help you to learn others.

For instance, “Shortsword-17” means a skill level of 17 with the shortsword. When you try to do something, you (or the GM) roll 3d against the appropriate skill, modified for that particular situation.

They can plow through many obstacles! The disadvantage is that stealth is impossible – each attempt at the tasks below has a chance of being heard.Bashing: You can destroy a door or a chest with a crushing or cutting weapon. Don’t bother with attack rolls! Roll damage at +2, or +1 per die, for All-Out Attack (Strong) – plus another +1 per die with Forced Entry at DX+1, or +2 per die at DX+2. The GM will subtract DR, multiply by 1.5 if you used a cutting attack, and reduce the target’s HP until it breaks. Swords dislike such abuse, and have a 3 in 6 chance (2 in 6 if fine, 1 in 6 if very fine) of bending: -1 to skill. Crowbars revel in destruction, and deliver swing+2 crushing.Forcing: Another option is to apply boot or shoulder to the door and overpower its attachments without annihilating it. Roll a Quick Contest: ST vs. the lock or hinge’s HP (6 to 46). You may add Lifting ST, +2 for a crowbar, and +1 with Forced Entry at DX+1 or +2 at DX+2, but have a penalty equal to the hardware’s DR (-3 to -24). For a barred or wedged portal, use the bar or wedge’s DR (-1 to -16) as a penalty, if greater than the lock or hinge’s DR; similarly, the portal resists with the bar or wedge’s HP (14 to 37), if higher than the lock or hinge’s HP. You must win to open the door. Repeated attempts have a cumulative -1 and cost 1 FP each.Bending: To pry apart metal bars in a grate or a portcullis, use the rules for forcing. A metal bar gives from -6 to -24 for DR, and has from 12 to 46 HP.Lifting: If the problem is a heavy barrier (fallen lintel, unlocked portcullis, etc.), the solution is to lift it.

Campaigns) GURPS Magic GURPS Thaumatology GURPS High-Tech GURPS Dungeon Fantasy (select material) GURPS Monster Hunters (select material) Rules from these books apply only where not superseded by this manifest.\nCharacters are cinematic but mortal Combat is fast, decisive, and dangerous Magic is powerful, flexible, and risky The game assumes competent protagonists, not average civilians Optional cinematic rules may be used at the GM’s discretion, but core mechanics remain grounded in GURPS resolution.\nCharacters may Move and Attack in the same turn without penalty, unless performing: All-Out Attacks All-Out Defenses This rule applies equally to PCs and NPCs Retreats, defenses, and active reactions function normally This replaces standard GURPS movement/attack limitations.All rolls use standard 3d6 roll-under mechanics.\nMargin of Success (MoS) is always calculated Margin of Failure (MoF) matters when relevant When multiple skills are rolled for a single action, the lowest MoS is used Critical successes and failures follow Basic Set rules unless explicitly overridden.Magic does not use fixed spell lists.All magic is constructed using Symbols, divided into:Create, Move, Control, Sense, Heal, Protect, WeakenAir, Water, Fire, Earth, Body, Mind, Light, Sound, Plant, Animal, Necromancy, Knowledge, Meta-MagicA spell consists of:\n1 Verb 1–3 Nouns Example:\nCreate + Fire → Fireball Control + Light → Invisibility To cast a spell:\nRoll each involved Symbol skill\nDetermine MoS for each roll\nThe lowest MoS becomes the spell’s final MoS\nMoS determines the spell’s strength and scaling\nIf any required roll fails, the spell fails.MoS determines the tier of effect, not just success.Exact mechanical outcomes are defined by the GM using these tiers as guidance.\nMagery governs: Maximum complexity of spells Maximum MoS spent per effect category A character may not spend more MoS on a single effect category than their Magery level Excess MoS may still be used, but increases magical risk (see Threshold Magic) Magic uses Threshold Magic, not fatigue-based costs.\nEach spell adds Threshold (T) instead of FP cost Threshold recovers over time at a fixed rate Exceeding Threshold risks Calamities Minor spells: 1–3 T Moderate spells: 4–6 T Major / Ultimate spells: 7–10+ T Calamities are magical, narrative, and potentially severe.\nMaintaining a spell is passive Casting a new spell while maintaining one imposes a –2 penalty per maintained spell Failure affects only the newly cast spell unless Threshold backlash occurs Damage uses standard GURPS damage types and DR Area effects, homing effects, control effects, etc. are determined by MoS allocation Magic may create effects that mimic Advantages, Attacks, or Conditions, but does not grant permanent traits unless explicitly allowed Technology Level is modern (TL8 baseline unless stated otherwise) Equipment legality, black markets, and scarcity are enforced Modern weapons are lethal; armor matters Technomagical items exist but are rare and controlled Monsters are ecological entities, not XP bundles Stat blocks emphasize: Behavior Ecology Tactics Monsters may retreat, negotiate, or act irrationally Not all encounters are balanced or fair Character advancement is point-based Advancement may occur through: Training Study Story milestones Exceptional play Power growth is intentional but controlled The GM:\nInterprets MoS outcomes Defines narrative consequences Adjudicates edge cases However, the GM does not override core mechanics without explicitly declaring a house rule.This document does three crucial things:\nIt locks physics before lore\nIt separates rules from rulings\nIt gives players confidence that mastery is possible\nNext logical steps (when you’re ready):\nA Magic Allocation Cheat Sheet (MoS → Damage / Area / Control) A Combat Reference Card for modern + magic interaction A “GM Only” Design Appendix explaining why these rules exist (kept out of player view) When you want, we can tighten this further for table print, or build the next layer without contaminating the core.should each section be its own note? like should 1. System Baseline have its own note?Short answer first, because clarity beats ceremony:No — not at first.\nThe Core Rules Manifest should remain one single note.Now the longer, more interesting answer: why that’s true, and when it stops being true.A constitution is powerful precisely because it’s hard to fragment.Your Core Rules Manifest is not a reference manual. It’s a statement of reality. The moment you split it into multiple notes, three bad things start happening:\nAuthority diffuses\nPlayers (and future-you) start asking “Which note overrides which?”\nDrift sneaks in\nOne section gets quietly updated, another doesn’t. Congratulations — you’ve invented accidental edition wars.\nObsidian starts lying\nLinks make everything look equally important, even when it isn’t.\nA constitution lives or dies by coherence. One file forces coherence.Right now, your manifest should be:\nOne document that can be printed, handed to a player, and sworn upon.\nIf you cannot print it as a single artifact without losing meaning, it’s too fragmented.There is a correct time to split — just not yet.You split only when a section gains subordinate structure.Here’s the rule of thumb:\nA section becomes its own note only when it needs children.\nLet’s apply that to your examples.1. System Baseline\nThis is declarative. It names books and authority. It has no moving parts.If it were its own note, you’d gain nothing and risk someone “editing the foundation.”Same for:\nTone and Power Assumptions Action Economy GM Authority Clause These are axioms, not systems.Unified Symbol Magic SystemRight now, it belongs in the manifest as a law.\nLater, it will absolutely spawn:\nMagic Allocation Tables Example Spells Edge Cases Design Rationale Player vs GM guidance When that happens, the manifest keeps the summary, and a separate document becomes:\n“Unified Symbol Magic — Full Rules”\nThe manifest links outward, but never imports detail inward.These will eventually want their own notes:\nMonsters (already happening naturally) Equipment economies Advancement rules Faction mechanics Dungeon / Gate rules But note the pattern:\nThose are procedural systems, not constitutional laws.Here’s the rule that prevents vault collapse:\nTop-level documents never link sideways. They only link downward.\nYour Core Rules Manifest should:\nSit at the root Have no backlinks that alter it Be referenced, not edited casually Everything else orbits it.For now, I’d suggest:00 - CORE RULES MANIFEST.md 01 - Magic System (Expansion).md 02 - Combat &amp; Damage Clarifications.md 03 - Monsters &amp; Ecology.md 04 - Equipment &amp; Economy.md GM - Design Notes (Private).mdNotice:\nThe manifest stays singular Expansions explain, but do not redefine GM notes are quarantined Fragmentation feels productive.\nCoherence is productive.You’ve already done the hard work: designing a system that hangs together. The manifest’s job is to freeze that coherence.Once the ice is solid, then you can build cities on top of it.Next time, if you want, we can:\nMark which sentences in the manifest are link anchors Decide which sections are immutable vs versioned Or design a “Player Cut” vs “GM Cut” without duplicating rules You’re building this the right way.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Core Rules Manifest (Canonical)","level":2,"id":"Core_Rules_Manifest_(Canonical)_0"},{"heading":"1.

meant to be quiet again.Long before furnaces and rail yards, the Calumet region was:\nmarshland slow water liminal ground between lake, river, and land Indigenous peoples avoided permanent settlement here.\nNot for superstition—because the ground shifted, flooded, swallowed structures.Even then, it was a place that didn’t like being owned.Chicago’s south industrial expansion turned Calumet into a machine.Steel mills, coke ovens, rail yards, and ship canals were packed together because:\nwater access rail access political indifference to pollution What that created:\nconstant vibration extreme heat gradients chemical runoff buried infrastructure layered on buried infrastructure Calumet wasn’t just polluted.\nIt was mechanically stressed for a century.Steel collapsed. Industry fled.What stayed behind:\nsealed tunnels abandoned furnaces slag heaps undocumented voids contaminated groundwater rusting machines still under tension The land didn’t recover.\nIt hollowed out.By the 1990s, Calumet was already:\nsemi-forgotten politically convenient to ignore dangerous in mundane ways Which made it perfect later.For decades, Calumet existed as:\n“future redevelopment land” EPA problem zones rail corridors no one wanted to map fully Nothing supernatural—just:\nsinkholes unexplained fires toxic gas releases structural collapses But here’s the key part for your setting:\nCalumet already behaved like a place where reality leaked.\nSo when Gates began appearing globally…It didn’t open in a neighborhood.It opened inside:\na sealed furnace hall surrounded by slag beneath rusted catwalks above flooded tunnels Sensors didn’t notice immediately.\nCameras didn’t work right.\nHeat signatures blended with the environment.By the time anyone understood what had happened:\nmonsters had space to spread mana had room to pool no civilians were present to trigger alarms The government’s internal conclusion was chilling:\n“If a Gate had to open somewhere, this was the least bad place.”\nThat decision shaped everything.In-world logic, not GM fiat:\nThe ground is fractured and hollow Old infrastructure forms natural containment chambers Heat and pressure align with fire- and metal-aligned Gates Subterranean networks allow migration Political will to fully cleanse the area is low Calumet isn’t cursed.It’s convenient.Today, Calumet is:\nsemi-abandoned semi-monitored quietly exploited It’s where:\ndangerous Gates are allowed to fester high-value - monster cores are harvested experimental containment is tested failures are buried Englewood taught the city a lesson.Calumet is where that lesson is applied.Among hunters, Calumet is known as:\n“The Furnace” “The Open Wound” “Where the city bleeds money” You don’t go there to survive.\nYou go there to get paid.And maybe not come back.This lets you:\njustify recurring Gates without escalation fatigue explain government tolerance seed corporate and cult interest tie Fire Opal–style threats naturally to the region contrast Englewood’s tragedy with Calumet’s exploitation Englewood was an accident.Calumet is a choice.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Calumet industrial area — <strong>Operational Zones (June 2025)</strong>","level":2,"id":"Calumet_industrial_area_—_**Operational_Zones_(June_2025)**_0"},{"heading":"🟥 ZONE C-1: <strong>The Furnace Core</strong>","level":2,"id":"🟥_ZONE_C-1_**The_Furnace_Core**_0"},{"heading":"🟧 ZONE C-2: <strong>Slag Fields</strong>","level":2,"id":"🟧_ZONE_C-2_**Slag_Fields**_0"},{"heading":"🟨 ZONE C-3: <strong>Rail Graveyard</strong>","level":2,"id":"🟨_ZONE_C-3_**Rail_Graveyard**_0"},{"heading":"🟪 ZONE C-4: <strong>Calumet River Contamination</strong>","level":2,"id":"🟪_ZONE_C-4_**Calumet_River_Contamination**_0"},{"heading":"🟩 ZONE C-5: <strong>Hunter Salvage Strip</strong>","level":2,"id":"🟩_ZONE_C-5_**Hunter_Salvage_Strip**_0"},{"heading":"⚫ ZONE C-6: <strong>Black Infrastructure</strong>","level":2,"id":"⚫_ZONE_C-6_**Black_Infrastructure**_0"},{"heading":"HOW CALUMET FEELS DIFFERENT FROM ENGLEWOOD","level":2,"id":"HOW_CALUMET_FEELS_DIFFERENT_FROM_ENGLEWOOD_0"},{"heading":"HOW TO PLACE THIS ON YOUR CHICAGO MAP","level":2,"id":"HOW_TO_PLACE_THIS_ON_YOUR_CHICAGO_MAP_0"},{"heading":"WHY CALUMET MATTERS NARRATIVELY","level":2,"id":"WHY_CALUMET_MATTERS_NARRATIVELY_0"},{"heading":"Want the Next Layer?","level":2,"id":"Want_the_Next_Layer?_0"},{"heading":"Calumet River &amp;

Testing behavior\nThe government wants to observe: mana diffusion under civilian load structural strain under vibration emotional/psychic interference Yes, they are measuring whether large crowds affect the Gate.They are not telling anyone.If PCs visit Navy Pier:\nNo immediate danger Security watches everyone Subtle mana distortion checks Rumor opportunities Increased military presence Magical interference Restricted access Possible containment alarms Much tighter lockdown Coast Guard presence Federal rapid-response team on standby The Navy Pier Gate is not dangerous because it’s open.It’s dangerous because:\nIt’s sealed imperfectly. It’s in the middle of the skyline. And if it fails during peak summer hours… That’s not a dungeon incident.That’s a national trauma event.These are businesses the city needs open to maintain the illusion.\nMid-range seafood restaurant (reduced seating) Deep-dish pizza spot (busy but understaffed) Tourist burger &amp; bar chain Coffee shop (heavily frequented by security personnel) Ice cream / funnel cake stand (seasonal, open weekends only) Vibe:\nOpen, but slightly emptier than peak summer. Staff are jumpy when Festival Hall is mentioned.\nNational coffee chain Local craft coffee cart Popcorn / cotton candy vendor Bottled water and souvenir kiosks Vibe:\nHigh foot traffic. Tourists unaware. Employees whisper about “construction delays.”\nFerris wheel (intermittent operation) Carousel Some arcade games Outdoor seating areas Public art exhibits Not operating:\nIndoor festival events Large exhibitions Major summer concert programming The Ferris wheel occasionally “shuts down for maintenance.”\nPlayers may notice it stalls briefly when mana fluctuations spike.\nSouvenir stores T-shirt shops Chicago sports merchandise Jewelry stand Kids toy store Foot traffic: moderate, not packed.\nLimited sightseeing boat tours Dinner cruises (shortened routes) Kayak rentals (restricted zones) Coast Guard presence is higher than normal.\nCertain lake coordinates are strictly off-limits.These appear open but are effectively dead.\nEvent rental offices Indoor theater spaces Private banquet halls Conference areas Some upper-level offices These areas are “under renovation.”\nFestival Hall interior Maintenance corridors Loading docks near the Gate anchor point Sub-basement access Several rooftop sections Construction walls are professionally done.\nSecurity presence is subtle but constant.If they look closely:\nSecurity personnel in plain clothes Federal-style unmarked SUVs Radio chatter using unfamiliar call signs Tourists occasionally escorted away from restricted corridors Slight static in cell service near certain walls Light pressure sensation (mages especially) Behind the scenes, the following quietly operate:\nFederal monitoring office (temporary) Mana flux instrumentation Structural stress monitoring Rapid response containment team on standby Psychological profiling team reviewing witness footage But none of that is visible unless players go digging.If they attempt:\nAccessing closed corridors Questioning staff aggressively Casting magic openly Flying drones Scanning for mana They will trigger:\nSoft surveillance first Then quiet intervention Then firm removal This is not Englewood.\nThis is optics territory.Navy Pier should feel:\n80% normal 15% tense 5% wrong That 5% is where your campaign lives.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Status (June 2025)","level":2,"id":"Status_(June_2025)_0"},{"heading":"What Happened","level":2,"id":"What_Happened_0"},{"heading":"The Opening (April 2025)","level":3,"id":"The_Opening_(April_2025)_0"},{"heading":"Why It’s A-Rank","level":2,"id":"Why_It’s_A-Rank_0"},{"heading":"The Seal","level":2,"id":"The_Seal_0"},{"heading":"The Tourist Exclusion Zone","level":2,"id":"The_Tourist_Exclusion_Zone_0"},{"heading":"Why This Gate Matters","level":2,"id":"Why_This_Gate_Matters_0"},{"heading":"1.

Life continues on the surface—jobs, traffic, summer festivals—but beneath that normalcy sits a growing lattice of Gates, quarantines, and quiet emergency powers. The public knows something is wrong. They do not know how wrong.The city has not collapsed. It has adapted.\nA series of \"containment incidents\" tied to infrastructure failures, chemical leaks, and extremist activity. Certain neighborhoods are restricted due to \"structural instability\" or \"environmental hazards.\" Increased federal presence is framed as counter-terrorism and disaster preparedness. Viral footage of \"animals\" or \"riots\" is dismissed as hoaxes or misinterpretations. Most people assume this is temporary.\nChicago is one of the highest Gate-density cities in North America. Several Gates have already been neutralized; others remain dormant, sealed, or unacknowledged. Residual mana is accumulating in underground spaces, old infrastructure, and abandoned buildings. Monsters have escaped containment at least twice. Cult activity is confirmed and escalating. Hunters understand that Chicago is being managed, not saved.\nEmergency authority invoked under existing disaster and homeland security frameworks. A dedicated task force operates quietly through shell agencies and utilities departments. Data is classified aggressively; whistleblowers disappear into legal limbo. City Hall cooperates under pressure. Police and fire departments receive limited briefings. First responders are told to withdraw from certain zones without explanation. Officially, no supernatural threat exists.Chicago hosts a large freelance hunter population, larger than average due to:\nHigh Gate frequency Abundant underground access points Strong black-market infrastructure Hunter culture in Chicago is:\nPragmatic Suspicious Highly networked Less heroic, more professional Reputation matters. Carelessness spreads quickly.Beneath the streets exists a parallel ecosystem:\nAbandoned subway spurs Flooded service tunnels Utility corridors Forgotten bomb shelters These spaces house:\nThe Subterranean Market Hunter safehouses Illegal clinics Artifact brokers Cult hideouts This underground is alive, shifting nightly.\nGovernment containment units (covert) Independent hunter crews Corporate interests (research &amp; salvage) Religious and esoteric cults Information brokers and fixers No single group is fully in control.\nGates appear unpredictably but favor older structures and underground spaces. Some Gates destabilize after partial clearing. Smaller \"micro-Gates\" open briefly, often ignored until damage is done. Mana residue persists after closure, warping environments. The Fire Opal Gate is one of the most dangerous confirmed examples.\nSummer heat mixed with unease Increased police presence without explanation Closed streets and construction zones everywhere Rumors spreading faster than facts A sense that something big is coming Chicago feels watched.Use Chicago as:\nA living hub between Gates A pressure cooker for faction conflict A place where choices have visible consequences A city that reacts to hunter actions Nothing resets between sessions.\n\"A Gate opened under the lake. They sealed it, but something escaped.\" \"Someone is paying double for fire-aligned cores.\" \"A cult thinks a god is about to be reborn.\" \"The tunnels are changing. Old maps don’t work anymore.\" \"Hunters went in last week. No bodies came out.\" Some of these are true.Chicago is not a dungeon.It is a system under stress.The players are not saviors.They are specialists operating in the cracks.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Chicago Overview — June 2025","level":1,"id":"Chicago_Overview_—_June_2025_0"},{"heading":"Status Summary","level":2,"id":"Status_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Public Narrative (What Civilians Believe)","level":2,"id":"Public_Narrative_(What_Civilians_Believe)_0"},{"heading":"The Reality (What Hunters Know)","level":2,"id":"The_Reality_(What_Hunters_Know)_0"},{"heading":"Government Response","level":2,"id":"Government_Response_0"},{"heading":"Federal","level":3,"id":"Federal_0"},{"heading":"State &amp; City","level":3,"id":"State_&_City_0"},{"heading":"Hunter Activity","level":2,"id":"Hunter_Activity_0"},{"heading":"The Subterranean World","level":2,"id":"The_Subterranean_World_0"},{"heading":"Factions Present","level":2,"id":"Factions_Present_0"},{"heading":"Gate Behavior","level":2,"id":"Gate_Behavior_0"},{"heading":"Tone &amp; Atmosphere","level":2,"id":"Tone_&_Atmosphere_0"},{"heading":"Campaign Use","level":2,"id":"Campaign_Use_0"},{"heading":"Current Rumors (June 2025)","level":2,"id":"Current_Rumors_(June_2025)_0"},{"heading":"GM Notes","level":2,"id":"GM_Notes_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"20_world_lore/21_cities/chicago/overview.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1768865782301,"modifiedTime":1768865806990,"sourceSize":4453,"sourcePath":"20_World_Lore/21_Cities/Chicago/Overview.md","exportPath":"20_world_lore/21_cities/chicago/overview.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":231,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"20_world_lore/22_factions/dhs_anomalous_response_division/legal_status.html":{"title":"Legal_Status","icon":"","description":"Hunters operate in a legal gray zone.

Reach C-1.Innate Spellcasting: Only water and knowledge spells. Improvisation up to 8 points, hardcore improvisation up to 63 points. Typically, a weird knows the Divination spell and the [Control Elemental] spell for its native element. Water Pool: A water weird dwells within a large pool filled with bubbling water. The pool must be at least 16 yards across and 6 yards deep. A water weird’s pool may be affixed only to a horizontal surface, and it may appear only in a right side up position (such as on the floor of a cavern). The surface must have sufficient depth to accommodate the pool. An elemental pool can also exist as a separate area inside a larger volume of the same element.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The base of the pool contains a portal to the weird’s native plane. Three times per day, the weird can summon elemental allies through this portal, as if casting [Summon Water Elemental], but summoning a group of up to ten elementals each worth up to 25% of the weird’s point value and with no preparation.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Any nonelemental creature entering a pool without the weird’s permission must win in a Quick Contest of Will with the weird each second or be irrevocably transformed into the elemental material of the pool. Creatures granted access to the pool by the weird are not subject to transformation or damage. However, creatures allowed to enter a pool must still provide their own protection from the elemental material, as well as the means to breathe and move within that enviroment. A weird is physically tied to its pool and cannot leave except to return to its native plane through the portal. A weird may rise up to its height above the surface of its pool, but the lower part of its body must always remain in contact with the elemental material. Once a weird exits the pool for its native plane, the portal closes, and the pool loses its special effects. Opening the portal works identically to the [Create Planar Gate] spell.

The character gets only one chance, no matter how much belladonna is consumed. The belladonna must be reasonably fresh (picked within the last week).However, fresh or not, belladonna is toxic. The character must succeed on an HT-4 roll or take 2d toxic damage.The only other way to remove the affliction is to cast Remove Curse on the character during one of the three days of the full moon. After receiving the spell, the character must succeed on a Will-4 roll to break the curse (the caster knows if the spell works). If the save fails, the process must be repeated.Characters undergoing this cure are often kept bound or confined in cages until the cure takes effect.Only afflicted lycanthropes can be cured of lycanthropy.SAMPLE LYCANTHROPESWereserpent [Serpent Kingdoms, page 69]Typical Stats – Human FormST:13HP:13Speed:6DX:12Will:10Move:6IQ:10Per:10HT:11FP:11SM+0Dodge:10Parry:11UDR:3* on torso (1 vs crushing)Glaive (14): swing 2d+2 cutting, Reach 2-3*; or thrust 2d-1 impaling (KYOS: 2d), Reach 1-3*.Alternate Form: A natural or an afflicted lycanthrope who is aware of his condition may assume a hybrid or an animal form as per Alternate Form (p.

He has the abilities of the form he is changing from until the transition is complete.An afflicted lycanthrope’s shapeshifting ability may manifest spontaneously in any stressful situation or at night during full moon. In a stressful situation, such as any situation that requires a Fright Check or a self-control roll for a mental disadvantage, or combat – the lycanthrope must make a Will roll to avoid shifting into his animal form. He needs to roll once per situation, and a roll of 14+ is always a failure.When a natural lycanthrope in his hybrid or animal form damages a creature with his bite, the creature must roll 3d vs. the HP of injury it received (maximum one roll per day). If it rolls under the damage amount, he becomes afflicted with lycanthropy. It gains the appropriate lycanthrope lens, but is unaware of its condition. The first transformation into the animal form happens at night during full moon or when the afflicted creature takes injury. When an afflicted lycanthrope shifts into his animal form this way, he becomes an NPC under the GM’s control until the next dawn, losing his identity and receiving the Wild Animal meta-trait (p.

no attack roll is necessary and its quarry may defend only by dodging and retreating. In addition, if it is moving through an SM+2 or smaller creature, this counts as an automatic slam attempt (Pyramid # 3-77, p. 6). Failure to dodge means being sucked inside and pinned if of lower SM than the black pudding, or partly stuck in the black pudding and grappled if of equal or greater SM. The victim can break free by winning a Quick Contest of ST (allowed only every 10 seconds if pinned; and on a 17 or 18, he becomes so entangled that he cannot escape on his own); the black pudding has +10 to ST if pinning or +5 if grappling. Engulfed victims cannot breathe. If they run out of breath before they break free, they start to suffocate (see&nbsp;Holding Your Breath, p. B351 and&nbsp;Suffocation, p. B436). The typical black pudding can pin/grapple one foe; later enemies are pushed along in front of it unless they win a Quick Contest of ST to prevent it from moving. The black pudding can actively constrict engulfed victims, attacking them each turn with a Constriction Attack (p. B43). This ability has effective ST 24.Acid:&nbsp;The creature secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material and metal, but does not affect stone. Any organic or metal creature or object touching the black pudding takes 1d-1 corrosion damage per second. Engulfed creatures and objects take it as&nbsp;Large-Area Injury&nbsp;(p. B400).Ooze Senses:&nbsp;An ooze’s entire body is a primitive sensory organ that can ascertain prey by scent and vibration. It uses standard range penalties instead of a -1/yard penalty when detecting smells, and gets a +5 bonus on Smell and Taste rolls (Sense roll 15). Its smell operates both in air and underwater. In addition, the ooze can detect vibrations in the air. It can locate prey in the dark, but cannot detect details. To use Vibration Sense, the ooze must make a Sense roll (10).

In addition, if it is moving through an SM+3 or smaller creature, this counts as an automatic slam attempt (Pyramid # 3-77, p. 6). Failure to dodge means being sucked inside and pinned if of lower SM than the black pudding, or partly stuck in the black pudding and grappled if of equal or greater SM. The victim can break free by winning a Quick Contest of ST (allowed only every 10 seconds if pinned; and on a 17 or 18, he becomes so entangled that he cannot escape on his own); the black pudding has +10 to ST if pinning or +5 if grappling. Engulfed victims cannot breathe. If they run out of breath before they break free, they start to suffocate (see&nbsp;Holding Your Breath, p. B351 and&nbsp;Suffocation, p. B436). The typical black pudding can pin/grapple one foe; later enemies are pushed along in front of it unless they win a Quick Contest of ST to prevent it from moving. The black pudding can actively constrict engulfed victims, attacking them each turn with a Constriction Attack (p. B43). This ability has effective ST 34.Acid:&nbsp;The creature secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material and metal, but does not affect stone. Any organic or metal creature or object touching the black pudding takes 1d-1 corrosion damage per second. Engulfed creatures and objects take it as&nbsp;Large-Area Injury&nbsp;(p. B400).Ooze Senses:&nbsp;An ooze’s entire body is a primitive sensory organ that can ascertain prey by scent and vibration. It uses standard range penalties instead of a -1/yard penalty when detecting smells, and gets a +5 bonus on Smell and Taste rolls (Sense roll 15). Its smell operates both in air and underwater. In addition, the ooze can detect vibrations in the air. It can locate prey in the dark, but cannot detect details. To use Vibration Sense, the ooze must make a Sense roll (10).

What monster can compete with a primordial fish monster with psionic powers? In D&amp;D 3.5 they were first introduced on the first pages of Monster Manual&nbsp;and then brought to their proper psionic shape in Expanded Psionics Handbook. Finally, the lore was greatly expanded in Lords of Madness, one of my favorite D&amp;D splatbooks. Lords of Madness&nbsp;also introduced three new aboleth variants - the stygian aboleth, the amphibious aboleth, and the uobilyth, also known as the aerial aboleth. I am aware of the other variations from the previous editions, such as the greater aboleth and the grand aboleth, but they won't be present in this post. The entries use psionic abilities from GURPS Psionic Powers and some unique psionic or biologial aboleth abilities. The entries are presented as a racial template and as a typical statblock. Bite (11):&nbsp;thrust 2d-2 cutting (KYOS: 3d-3 cutting). Reach C.Tentacle (11):&nbsp;thrust 4d-2 crushing (KYOS: 5d+1 crushing) + follow-up 1d corrosion (10 1-minute cycles, HT-3 resist). Reach C. 1-3. Being moistened with cool, fresh water negates cycle damage. Using the follow-up damage costs 1 FP.Mucus Cloud (HT): Any creature that makes skin-to-skin contact with the aboleth must make a successful HT roll or lose the ability to breathe air and gain that ability to breathe water for a number of minutes equal to the margin of failure. Using this ability costs 1 FP.Mental Blow (15): The aboleth can overload someone’s brain with a powerful psychic attack. If it wins a Quick Contest of skill vs. his victim’s Will (use the range penalties on the Size and Speed/Range Table (B550)), his victim is stunned. On subsequent turns, he can roll against Will to snap out of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traits: Amphibious; Callous; Doesn’t Breathe (Gills);

In its natural form, it resembles a goblin–wolf hybrid with terrible jaws and sharp claws. Barghests come into the world to feed on blood and souls and thus grow stronger.Barghest [Monster Manual, page 22]Typical Stats - BarghestSharp Claws (13):&nbsp;thrust 1d cutting (KYOS: 1d+2 cutting), Reach C.Vampiric Bite (13):&nbsp;thrust 1d cutting (KYOS: 1d+2 cutting), Reach C. The barghest can drain the victim’s life if the victim is helpless (pinned, stunned, unconscious, etc.), grappled, or willing. If he is wearing armor, the barghest’s biting damage must penetrate its DR. Once the barghest has bitten through the victim’s DR, he can drain 1 HP per second from him. For every 3 HP stolen, the barghest heals 1 HP or 1 FP (his choice). He cannot raise his HP or FP above normal this way.Change Shape:&nbsp;The barghest can shapeshift into a goblin or a wolf (p. B458). The process takes 10 seconds.Spell-Like Abilities&nbsp;(Alternative Abilities):<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2017/02/sorcery-mind-control-spells.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2017/02/sorcery-mind-control-spells.html\" target=\"_self\">Berserker</a>&nbsp;(10);<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2017/05/sorcery-movement-spells-iii.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2017/05/sorcery-movement-spells-iii.html\" target=\"_self\">Levitation 2</a>&nbsp;(10);<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2017/05/sorcery-mind-control-spells-iii.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2017/05/sorcery-mind-control-spells-iii.html\" target=\"_self\">Suggestion</a>&nbsp;(10).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traits:&nbsp;Bad Grip 1; Discriminatory Smell; Extended Lifespan 1; Fur; Horizontal; Infravision.Skills**:**&nbsp;Brawling-13; Stealth-13; Tracking-13.Notes: Size 2 hexes.Creature Type**:**&nbsp;Outsider (Evil, Lawful).Typical Stats – Greater BarghestSharp Claws (14):&nbsp;thrust 1d+2 cutting (KYOS: 2d+2 cutting), Reach C-1.Vampiric Bite (14):&nbsp;thrust 1d+2 cutting (KYOS: 2d+2 cutting), Reach C.

Vrock [Monster Manual, page 48]Sharp Claws (14):&nbsp;thrust 2d cutting (KYOS: 3d+1 cutting). Reach C-1.Sharp Beak (14):&nbsp;thrust 2d large piercing (KYOS: 3d+1 large piercing). Reach C.Stunning Screech (14):&nbsp;Once per hour the vrock can emit a screech that stuns every non-demon everyone in a cone-shaped area. Cones use special rules; see&nbsp;Area and Spreading Attacks&nbsp;(p. B413). The cone has a maximum width of 5 yards at the maximum range of 10 yards. This ability has no 1/2D range. Everyone within must resist with HT; Protected Hearing gives +5, Hard of Hearing gives +4, and those with Deafness are immune.Spores:&nbsp;Once every 15 seconds the vrock can emit a 2-yard radius cloud of spores around himself. This requires a Concentrate maneuver and costs 1 FP. The spores work as a contact agent, ignoring unsealed DR and dealing 1 point of toxic damage every 10 seconds for 6 cycles total. At the end of this time, the victim is covered with a tangle of viny growths. The vines are harmless and wither away in 1d4 days. The spores can be removed with a successful Physician roll (takes 10 seconds). Bless, neutralize poison, or remove disease kills the spores, as does sprinkling the victim with a vial of holy water.Dance of Ruin:&nbsp;To use this ability, a group of at least three vrocks must join hands in a circle, dancing wildly and chanting. At the end of 16 seconds of dancing, a wave of crackling energy flashes outward in a 32-yard radius. All creatures except for demons within the radius take 6d crushing damage. This affects even insubstantial creatures. Stunning, paralyzing, or slaying one of the vrocks stops the dance. The dance costs each vrock 2 FP.Spell-Like Abilities&nbsp;(Alternative Abilities):<br>Anarchic Weapon (14):&nbsp;See this&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2016/10/imbuements-and-sorcery-align-weapon.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2016/10/imbuements-and-sorcery-align-weapon.html\" target=\"_self\">post</a>.<br>Apportation 14:&nbsp;See this&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2017/05/sorcery-movement-spells-ii.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2017/05/sorcery-movement-spells-ii.html\" target=\"_self\">post</a>.<br>Mirror Image 1:&nbsp;See this&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2018/03/sorcery-illusion-and-creation-spells-ii.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2018/03/sorcery-illusion-and-creation-spells-ii.html\" target=\"_self\">post</a>.<br>Teleport (10):&nbsp;See this&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2016/11/sorcery-movement-and-communication.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2016/11/sorcery-movement-and-communication.html\" target=\"_self\">post</a>.<br>Unholy Weapon (14):&nbsp;See this&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2016/10/imbuements-and-sorcery-align-weapon.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2016/10/imbuements-and-sorcery-align-weapon.html\" target=\"_self\">post</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traits:&nbsp;Combat Reflexes;

It can use only six mouths at the same time, and can create protoplasmic manipulators to push objects (hence No Fine Manipulators, not No Manipulators). It can spit acid, soften earth, confuse creatures with its gibbering, and attack six times per second. It has so many eyes that it effectively has Injury Tolerance (No Eyes).Gibbering Mouther [Monster Manual, page 126]Vampiric Bite (12):&nbsp;1d+1 cutting (KYOS: 2d cutting), Reach C. The gibbering mouther can drain the victim’s life if the victim is helpless (pinned, stunned, unconscious, etc.), grappled, or willing. If he is wearing armor, the gibbering mouther’s biting damage must penetrate its DR. Once the gibbering mouther has bitten through the victim’s DR, it can drain 1 HP per second from him. For every 3 HP stolen, the gibbering mouther heals 1 HP or 1 FP (its choice). It cannot raise its HP or FP above normal this way.Spit Acid (12):&nbsp;1d-1 corrosion. Ranged attack (Acc 3, Range 10/10), costs 1 FP.Gibbering:&nbsp;As soon as a mouther spots something edible, it begins a constant gibbering. When a creature hears this gibbering, it must roll a Fright Check using the Confusion table (GURPS Powers, p. 85). If a victim succeeds at his Fright Check, he will be unaffected by this ability for one hour.Ground Manipulation:&nbsp;A gibbering mouther can cause stone and earth in a 4-yard radius around it to become a morass akin to quicksand. This requires a Concentrate maneuver and costs 1 FP. Mired creatures are grappled with ST 12. Their only way to free themselves is to break free with a successful Quick Contest of ST. Softening stone requires two consecutive Concentrate maneuvers.

In fact, there’s nothing human about them at all – they aren’t sapient, don’t use tools, and don’t speak. Though they have no hands, their feet sport large claws. They’re usually encountered in groups of five or more, active day or night. They are most commonly found in the badlands of al-Haz and al-Wazif or in mountainous areas of the Great Forest and the Emperor’s Forest.Harpies take a bizarre, compulsive delight in befouling food and drink; the stench they leave sends most other beings reeling, and the food will be completely inedible. Otherwise, they act much like aggressive predatory animals, with neither a fear of humans nor any great interest in human prey.

Reach C-1.Adhesive: A mimic exudes a thick slime that acts as a powerful adhesive, holding fast any creatures or items that touch it. Adhesive has ST 12 and can only be damaged by cutting or burning attacks. Strong alcohol dissolves the adhesive, but the mimic still can grapple normally. A mimic can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 30 seconds after the creature dies. See Binding, p. B40 for more details.Mimic Shape: A mimic can assume the general shape of any object that fills roughly 150 cubic feet (5 feet by 5 feet by 6 feet), such as a massive chest, a stout bed, or a wide door frame. The creature cannot substantially alter its size, though. A mimic’s body is hard and has a rough texture, no matter what appearance it might present. Anyone who examines the mimic by touch can detect the ruse by making a successful Touch roll. Of course, by this time it is generally far too late.The mimic can always take on the form of an object he can see or touch. Once it have assumed a form, it can opt to memorize it by concentrating for one minute. This allows the mimic to shapeshift into that form at any time. It can memorize a number of forms equal to its IQ.

They have four small, pincer-like legs that they use to clamp onto the necks of their victims. They are rusty-red to reddish brown in color, and their eyes and feet are yellowish. The dangling proboscises of stirges are pink at the tip, fading to gray at the base (near their heads). Stirges must be killed to be removed, due to their strong grip. If an attack against an attached stirge misses, make another attack roll against the victim’s Armor Class to see if the attack hits the victim instead. Caution is advisable when attempting to remove an attached stirge.Stirges can breed in captivity, but a constant supply of blood is needed. Stirges mostly kill low-level humans, animals and children, so the arrival of these predators in any civilized territory is always a cause for alarm. Fortunately, even a low-level group of adventurers or town militia is usually capable of ending the menace with little or no loss of life.Ecology: Stirges have an acute sense of smell, can see in the dark, and can sense heat sources within 200 feet. These senses keep stirges informed when living creatures enter their habitat. Creatures with a natural AC of 3 or better are usually immune to a stirge’s blood draining attack, since their hides are too thick to penetrate. As a consequence, huge nests of stirges live symbiotically with some evil dragons. Characters who protect their entire bodies with special leather or better armor (this special armor costs two to three times more than normal armor) can safely approach a stirge. Even the slightest gap in the protection is seen and smelled by the creature, and a successful attack roll means the creature has broken through the weakness and locked on. After a stirge has gorged itself by draining blood, it sleeps for one day, plus one day for every 2 points of blood it drank (the maximum sleep period is after drinking 12 points of blood – seven days). During this period of rest, silent attackers can impose a -2 penalty to the stirges’ surprise roll, as the beasts wake slowly and remain drowsy for a few moments. They are most vulnerable at this time. While certain species of stirges prefer to dine on human blood, most are content with any large mammal, like cows, moose, and deer. Experienced druids and rangers usually recognize the traces of a stirge colony by the occurrences of mysteriously drained and dead animals in the vicinity. A stirge colony’s territory extends for only a mile in diameter, so stirges move around a lot after they’ve drained a region of the available blood. Often, the presence of stirges is only discovered long after the colony has departed, making it very difficult to track them.ST 5; DX 15; IQ 4; HT 11.Will 10; Per 10; Speed 6.5; Dodge 9; Move 2 (ground); 12 (air). SM-5; HP 7 (): Grappling (17); Innate Attack [piercing] (17); Damage: 1d-2; If the proboscis penetrates the victim’s DR, the stirge drains 1 HP per second from him. For every 3 HP stolen, the stirge heals either 1 HP or 1 FP. The stirge cannot raise HP or FP above normal this way. A stirge is vulnerable when feeding in this manner and will be unable to dodge any attack directed at it. A missed attack, however, may hit the stirge’s victim!

However, any character not already able to use spells gains has -1 to ST, DX, IQ, and HT for as long as the book is in her possession or while she uses its power. A book of infinite spells contains 2d+22 pages. The nature of each page is determined by a 1d roll: 1-3, arcane spell; 4-6, divine spell.Determine the exact spell randomly.Once a page is turned, it can never be flipped back—paging through a book of infinite spells is a one-way trip. If the book is closed, it always opens again to the page it was on before the book was closed. When the last page is turned, the book vanishes.Once per day the owner of the book can cast the spell to which the book is opened. If that spell happens to be one that the character can cast via her own spellcasting abilities, she can cast it up to four times per day. The pages cannot be ripped out without destroying the book. Similarly, the spells cannot be cast as scroll spells, nor can they be copied into a spellbook—their magic is bound up permanently within the book itself.The owner of the book need not have the book on her person in order to use its power.

When the sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates with explosive force, dealing 3d crushing damage (on a miss, check for scatter; see p. B414), affecting both substantial and insubstantial targets. The target takes damage normally; anything nearby receives “collateral damage” equal to basic damage divided (2 x the distance in yards from the blast).If a direct hit was landed, then the target becomes encircled by a shimmering force globe, just like a spherical Force Dome. The sphere contains its subject for 1 minute. Unlike Force Dome, this barrier allows air to pass, so the subject may breathe freely. The subject may struggle, but the sphere cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within. The subject is protected by the sphere – the sphere has DR 6.Most targets resist by moving fast enough to get out – use the higher of DX or twice Basic Speed, DR provides no bonuses.
